	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  The simulation in the first module was rather simple: one of
	  the elevators arrives and that the entirely of a
	  replica. Most real-world phenomena are a bit more complex
	  than that. This module takes us into the world of queuing
	  theory as we simulate a multi-server multi-client setting: a
	  hair salon. One or more hairdressers have their individual
	  workstations at which they can provide a service to one
	  customer at a time. Customers may choose to wait for their
	  turn in a lounge, but having to wait can lead to churn
	  &mdash; a customer might just walk out without ever getting
	  served. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  A situation of this kind gives rise to many questions of
	  interest: how long do the customers typically need to wait,
	  what proportion of customers are lost to churn, are any of
	  the hairdressers and their workstations idle? Gathering
	  statistics over numerous replicas may again shed light on
	  what to do: how many seats to provide in the lobby, how many
	  hairdressers to employ simultaneously, and how to model
	  service times and customer preferences?
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Simulate a service</li>
	    <li>Adjust the parameters of an arrival process</li>
	    <li>Study the effect of capacity constraints, policies, and preferences</li>
	    <li>Measure and analyze basic performance measures of a queueing model</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Based on the video, how would you quantify the smoothness of
	  service of a process that invoves people waiting in line to
	  be served at one of multiple service points? Briefly discuss
	  what you would measure and in what units, based on your
	  intuition and prior knowledge. There is no need to look
	  anything up for this response, besides watching the video.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Queue</li>
	    <li>Service time</li>
	    <li>Waiting time</li>
	    <li>Capacity</li>
	    <li>Arrival process</li>
	    <li>Churn</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>	
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	  Should anything be missing or insufficient,
	  please <a target="_blank"

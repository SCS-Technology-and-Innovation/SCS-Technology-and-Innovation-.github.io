	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  Some problems are easy. Like the matching problem in CCCS
	  620: turn it into a network flow problem and voil&agrave;,
	  there is an efficient (deterministic polynomial time)
	  solution algorithm. Some are hard. Like the scheduling
	  problem in CCCS 620: no known approach is guaranteed to
	  produce an optimal solution in a reasonable amount of
	  time. We start off CCCS 660 with another problem of this
	  kind, one for which we have to make do with what happens to
	  be at hand: we will leverage an efficient algorithm to a
	  simpler problem to arrive at an approximate solution, and
	  then throw a heuristic into the mix to try to improve upon
	  that.

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Formulate an optimization problem</li>
	    <li>Consider the computational complexity of a problem</li>
	    <li>Apply an existing approximation algorithm</li>
	    <li>Apply an existing metaheuristic</li>	    
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  Browse <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1356580293">the
	  textbook by Taillard</a> (that is conveniently focused on
	  the problem we will be using to explore these concepts) for
	  a few minutes to get used to the vocabulary that awaits you
	  in the live session. Yes, there are 287 pages in it. No, you
	  do not have to look at all of them. Just skim it for a bit
	  so you can later recall having seen things there if anything
	  related to metaheuristics poses challenges to you later in
	  life.
	</p>
	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  After browsing the above textbook for at least a few
	  minutes, put it away and then carry out the following
	  thought exercise without consulting further sources: In your
	  own words, try to capture or at least speculate on your
	  present understanding of what are the key differences
	  between an <i>algorithm</i>, a <i>heuristic</i>, and a
	  <i>meta</i>heuristic. Please <strong>do not look it up
	  specifically</strong>or ask an AI assistant to do this for
	  you. It is completely acceptable to be confused or mistaken
	  and elaborate educated guesses are most welcome.

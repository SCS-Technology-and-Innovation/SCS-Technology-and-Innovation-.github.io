	  <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	  <p>
	    Substitute the artificially generated car attributes with a real
	    data set (such
	    as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gagandeep16/car-sales">this
	      example</a>) and adapt the example code to work with some of
	    those attributes instead. Add some kind of a label in the
      visualization to identify each car (possibly by model and year
	    or by listing number)
	  </p>
	  <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	  <p>
	    Modify the example code to look for good options of houses to
	    buy. Either generate artificial data on houses (like we did with
	    the cars in the example code) or use a real-world dataset of
	    your choice. Consider carefully which attributes to maximize and
	    which to minimize. Add some kind of a label in the visualization
	    to identify each house (possibly by address or by listing
	    number).
	  </p>
	  <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
	  <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	  <p>
	    Read about <em>Pareto fronts</em>. Summarize the concept of
	    Pareto optimality in your own words and discuss its relationship
	    with the example code for this session. Try to find out
	    what <em>diversity</em> means in the context of Pareto fronts.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Remember to clearly cite your sources and share good ones with your classmates.
	  </p>
	  <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	  <p>
	    Read about <em>other</em> options to handling decision-maker
	    preferences in multi-objective optimization other than assigning
	    weights to the individual objective functions (like we did with
	    emissions, milage, and miles per gallon in the example
	    code). Summarize your findings and discuss the applicability of
	    the alternatives you found to diverse real-world situations you
	    can think of that would benefit from them.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Remember again to clearly cite your sources and share good ones
	    with your classmates.

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  Things tend to multiply and branch. Modelling a process that
	  either creates multiple alternatives paths (like possible
	  ways to play a chess game given the current board layout) or
	  in which entities split into two or more (like a bacteria
	  splitting and filling a petri dish over time) is not as hard
	  as it may sound. The ideal model for this are <em>trees</em>
	  and we also get a lot of intuitive-sounding terminology to
	  sweeten the deal (leaves, roots, branches, and such). 
	</p>
	<p>
	  This last module focuses on understanding the (potentially
	  exponential) growth that a <em>branching process</em> can
	  exhibit under unrestricted growth. We also impose hard
	  limits on the total population and the depth of the
	  resulting tree so that we can study how the rate at which
	  splitting happens and the rate at which the rate itself
	  changes over time affect the resulting tree.
	  </p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Model branching processes with trees</li>
	    <li>Identify and name elements of a (mathematical) tree</li>
	    <li>Recognize conditions for exponential growth</li>
	    <li>Recognize extinction conditions</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Fiction often brings up the idea of branching, parallel
	  realities in which we choose every possible option whenever
	  we make a choice. Think back on this instant on which you do
	  this assessment, think of the branches of reality would have
	  spun off within the last hour if every choice you made that
	  could lead to any impactful consequence had created a new
	  parallel universe with a new you in it. How long do you
	  think it took you to create the last ten variants? A minute,
	  an hour, a day, a week, a month? Make a little diagram of
	  what were the choices and the options (feel free to replace
	  any personal information with just generic labels like X, Y,
	  Z of 1, 2, 3 for the choices and the options) that shows the
	  way in which the branches were created so as to show how
	  many decisions were involved and how many options were there
	  for each decision.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Recursion</li>      
	    <li>Tree</li>
	    <li>Branching</li>
	    <li>Growth</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>	
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.

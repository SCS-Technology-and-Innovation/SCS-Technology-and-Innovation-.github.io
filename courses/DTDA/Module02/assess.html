    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Create the following adjustments in the example code, either
      independently of one another or combined in the way of your
      choosing.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow for non-square but still rectangular cities, in which
	the image width and the image height do not necessarily
	coincide.</li>
      <li>Define variable to control the length a margin that
	determines how far from the edge of town do all restaurants need
	to be. Accomodate the example code to respect the margin both in
	terms of row and column.</li>
      <li>Make the margin apply upon placing the restaurants pseudorandomly
	in such a manner that no restaurant is ever placed at a distance of
	that margin or smaller from another restaurant.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Document examples of the resulting delivery territories with
  screenshots and discussion of the properties of the territories and
  how they differ from the other scenarios.
</p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
<p>
  For each restaurant, introduce a new attribute to represent the
  range of that restaurant, meaning that it only delivers to addresses
  within that range (that is, at a distance that is at most the
  specified range). When assigning the territory of each restaurant,
  respect this range.
</p>
<p>
Now, instead of creating a fixed number of restaurants to start with,
create them one by one and update their respective terrories after
each new opening. Keep adding restaurants until every address in the
city will be within the (range-respecting) territory of a
restaurant.

    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
<p>
  Read
  the <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-fascinating-world-of-voronoi-diagrams-da8fc700fa1b">blog
  article on Voronoi Diagrams</a> (or a similar writing of your
  choosing). Build a list of all terms and concepts that you are not
  yet thoroughly comfortable with.
</p>
<p>
For each item on the list, classify it into one of the following categories:
<ol>
  <li>You plan to learn more about on your own before next class</li>  
  <li>You expect to learn more about it later in this course</li>
  <li>You expect to learn more about it later in this study program</li>
  <li>You expect to learn more about it later in life</li>
  <li>You expect never to have to learn what it means</li>
</ol>
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
<p>
  Select at least three of the <em>links to additional material</em>
  at the bottom of
  the recommended <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-fascinating-world-of-voronoi-diagrams-da8fc700fa1b">blog
  post</a> and read through them. For each one, write a paragraph or
  two in your own words to describe why you chose it and what you
  learned by reading it.

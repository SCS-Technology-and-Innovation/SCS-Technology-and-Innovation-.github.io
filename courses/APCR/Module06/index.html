	<h1>Ethics: responsibility, explainability, bias and privacy</h1>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	  When contemplating on a computational solution to a problem,
	  one must pause and reflect upon both the obvious and the
	  less obvious impacts the proposal may have in the society,
	  the economy, and the environment, whether immediately or
	  after a significant delay. Aspects to focus on include
	  responsible use of technology (fairness, benefit, risk) as
	  well as explainability (the reasoning behind the decisions),
	  possible presence of bias in data sets or assumptions or the
	  ways in which design decisions are taken, as well as
	  possible breaches to the privacy of individuals (either in
	  the building or the employment of the proposed solution).

	  <strong>There is no new assessment in this module.</strong>
	  The tools, techniques and concepts of this module contribute
	  to successful completion of upcoming assessments and can
	  also be leveraged in previous assessments that have not yet
	  been turned in.
	</p>	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	</p>	
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Discuss ethical concerns arising from proposed research
	  or the use of its results</li>
	  <li>Identify ways in which technology can be developed and
	  used responsibly</li>
	  <li>Identify potential sources of bias and plan how to
	  counter them</li>
	  <li>Analyze possible implications to the privacy of
	  individuals arising from proposed research or the use of its
	  results</li>
	</ul>

        <h2 class="topic-heading">Tools</h2>
	<p>
	  Ethics in research involves various principles such as
	  responsibility, explainability, bias, and privacy. Several
	  tools can aid researchers in upholding ethical standards in
	  these areas:
	  <ul class="flex-horizontal border-none">
	    <li><strong>Data Management Plans (DMPs)</strong>: DMPs
	    outline how research data will be collected, stored,
	    shared, and preserved. This ensures responsible data
	    handling and future access for verification.</li>
	    <li><strong>Peer Review</strong>: The traditional method
	    of having colleagues scrutinize research proposals and
	    publications helps identify flaws and ensures research
	    quality and ethical considerations.</li>
	    <li><strong>Randomization</strong>: Randomly assigning
	    participants to groups helps control for pre-existing
	    differences and ensures a fair comparison between
	    groups.</li>
	    <li><strong>Informed Consent</strong>: Participants must
	    be fully informed about the research, its potential risks
	    and benefits, and their right to withdraw before agreeing
	    to take part. Consent forms should be clear and easy to
	    understand.</li>
	    <li><strong>De-identification</strong>: Removing personal
	    identifiers from data helps protect participant privacy
	    while allowing for valuable research to be conducted.</li>
	  </ul>

    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Browse online for real estate properties and mortgage interest
      rates. Using the example tool from class, run the numbers on
      what the time to make a profit looks like for at least three
      different properties and the mortgage conditions you
      identified. Try to be realistic also with sales price of the
      property in terms of data you find on how property value
      increases over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to cite clearly all your sources and report your numerical
      findings clearly.
    </p>
	<h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Many rental websites (such as zumper.com) show statistics on the
      rent trends in the neighborhoods of the properties that are
      listed as available rentals. Poke around websites to get an idea
      of what would be a realistic rent increase rate for the
      neighborhood of your chosen real estate from the basic stage of
      this assessment and examine how changes in the rate of increase
      of the rent and the initial rent affect the point at which your
      monthly balance from being a landlord becomes profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Document the investigation (citing all sources) and make either a data
      table or a data visualization (with the tool of your choice, even by
      hand) to illustrate your findings.
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about how to calculate return on investment (ROI) for real
      estate. Report your findings in writing and discuss particularly
      what would need to be changed (added, modified, removed) from
      the in-class example tool for you to be able to determine
      whether to invest in real estate and what rent to charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to clearly cite your sources.

	<h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      How about building a new duplex, living on one unit and renting
      out the other one?  How would such an arrangement affect the
      mortgage terms and the taxation? Investigate and write down if
      and how the calculations of our model would have to be adjusted
      to accomodate this scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it be very different for purchasing and renocating an even
      larger multi-unit building? Can conclusions made from one
      scenario extend to another without becoming fully invalid?

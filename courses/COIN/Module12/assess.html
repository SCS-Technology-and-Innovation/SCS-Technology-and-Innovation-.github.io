	<h1>Scenario A, final phase</h1>

	<img width="400"
	src="https://github.com/SCS-Technology-and-Innovation/DDDM/blob/main/COIN/scenarios/phone12.png?raw=true"
	alt="I've added the list of pothole coordinates and a severity
	on a scale from 1 (minor annoyance) to 5 (traffic-stopper) on
	the website, as requested. The jogging ladies are already
	questioning the ratings since they were hoping the road that
	leads to the lakeside parking lot to be recognized as a
	priority, but it's listed as a two. Any ideas on how to calm
	them down?">

	<p>
	  After successfully segmenting the pavement defects into
	  individual images, you have sent your colleagues, the
	  asphalt repair team, to visit and label a training
	  set. After that, Robin trained a deep-learning model to
	  assign a severity to the images. You are very proud of this,
	  but you were also expecting these types of issues (as
	  indicated in the text message you received) since you
	  already knew some of the residents of the town tend to think
	  that their problem is more important than anyone else's.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You'd like to add a button to the pothole ranking list so that
	  residents can see the photo of each defect along with an explanation
	  of why it was assigned a specific severity. The first part (the photos
	  of the defects) is easy to do, and Robin can set it up by the end of
	  day, but the second part (the explanation of severity) is an obstacle
	  because you have no idea why the deep-learning model gives these
	  outputs, so there seems to be no way for you to make the process more
	  transparent.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Explore and discuss alternatives for creating a severity
	  rating that can be justified in terms that the residents'
	  jogging club will (hopefully) find informative. Combine
	  writing, diagrams, and pseudocode as needed in your
	  response.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Browse through
	  <a href="https://thepythoncode.com/article/explainable-ai-model-python">this
	  Python XAI tutorial</a> and discuss how applicable the
	  suggested approaches could be for creating an explainable
	  pavement defect classification system like the one we need.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Watch
	  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/explainable-ai-tutorial">this
	  20-minute video tutorial</a> by Gade et al. (in double speed
	  if you're an impatient listener), and then summarize the key
	  points in your own words. Attach a list of unfamiliar terms,
	  if any.

    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Browse through the scientific article
	  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-022-00532-2"><em>Obtaining
	  genetics insights from deep learning via explainable
	  artificial intelligence</em> (Novakovsky et al.,
	  2023)</a>. Then, discuss in writing how vital you find XAI
	  to be in medical applications. Discuss any other applied
	  fields in which you think explainability is not just
	  nice-to-have, but actually critical for the employment of
	  any AI applications.

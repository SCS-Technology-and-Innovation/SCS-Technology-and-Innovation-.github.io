	<h1>Recap</h1>
	<p>
	  Planning (Module 3) is a good way forward when there is a
	  single decision maker to termine which action is taken by
	  which actors at any given time. In practice, it is not
	  always so. The situation may call for a collaboration among
	  multiple decision makers and, often, the setting is actually
	  a competitive one in which everyone's interests do not align.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The mathematical study of these situations is
	  called <em>game theory</em>, whether competitive or
	  collaborative. Computational intelligence that needs to make
	  decisions with multiple cooks in the metaphorical kitchen
	  generally benefits from incorporating these concepts into
	  its design.

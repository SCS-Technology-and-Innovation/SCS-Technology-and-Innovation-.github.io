	<h1>Recap</h1>
	<p>
	  Many of the topics in this course build upon what is learned
	  in CCCS 610. If you are taking that course in parallel
	  during the same term, no worries, you will do just fine
	  &mdash; it is not a pre-requisite, rather a helpful
	  synergy. Some learners may be taking this course as a
	  stand-alone, which is also perfectly fine, and are
	  nonetheless welcome to take CCCS 610 at a later time for a
	  more computational view of the skills honed in this course.
	</p>
	<p>
	In CCCS 610, we often rely on pseudo-random numbers for
	data. This module is no different, in that sense. This course,
	however, leaves the program code outside the spotlight to
	focus on the mathematical concepts more than on the details of
	the implementation. Interested participants who already took
	610 are nonetheless encouraged to experiment with how to apply
	what we learn in 620 and try out their wings on how much of it
	to replicate in Python. Such explorations are great for
	building a personal portfolio of achievements in a public code
	repository such as Github.

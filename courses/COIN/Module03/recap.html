	<h1>Recap</h1>
	<p>
	  Logic (Module 2) allows us to describe the world as it is
	  now. Temporal logic also lets us talk about how the world
	  will be. The topic of Module 3, Planning, focuses on how to
	  choose what actions to take in terms of what pre-requisite
	  world condition must be met for an action to be feasible and
	  what changes will the action impose on the state of the
	  world.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The ultimate goal is to take the world from a
	  (well-described) initial state to a desired (target) state
	  through a sequence of actions that are all valid in the
	  sense described in the above paragraph. Furthermore, the
	  shortest such sequence is of special interest. One way to
	  search for short sequences is with heuristics (Module 1),
	  but also formal optimization approaches (like those of CCCS
	  640) are common for smaller problem instances.

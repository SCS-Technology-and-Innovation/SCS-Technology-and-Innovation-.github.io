	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  Many popular (and powerful) computational techniques are
	  inspired by biology, physics, or chemistry. When the brain
	  learns, the neurons (brain cells) adjust their synaptic
	  connections to other neurons. A classic computational model
	  that tries to capture the way in which neurons operate is
	  called perceptron. It is a neat little mathematical
	  representation where an input (represented by a vector) and
	  the current "state of learning" of the perceptron
	  (represented by another vector known as its weights) are
	  combined with linear algebra (an inner product) to produce
	  value that can then be fed into an activation function
	  (often a threshold) to produce a yes/no output from it. One
	  can "make the neuron learn" (train it) by providing inputs
	  for which the desired outputs are known ahead of time, then
	  compare the generated output with the desired one, and
	  adjust the weights little by little until the perceptron
	  systematically gets it right. Of course, the model being so
	  simple, it cannot learn just anything &mdash; only linearly
	  separable tw0-class problems &mdash; but if one combines
	  many perceptrons (to build a brain instead of just a single
	  cell), the possibilities become vast.

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Understand the inner workings of a perceptron</li>
	    <li>Train a perceptron by adjusting the weights upon
	    errors</li>
	    <li>Compute common performance measures for a
	    perceptron</li>
	    <li>Combine multiple perceptrons to create a layer of
	    neurons</li>
	    <li>Represent base 10 (decimal) class labels in base 2
	    (binary)</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  Our attempts to comprehend artificial brains benefit from a
	  refresher on how our own brains operate. The below video
	  might help.

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Training a computational perceptron (neuron) is in effect
	  trial and error, with feedback on what the error was. Based
	  on having watched the video (please refrain from looking
	  things up again for the benefit of exercising original
	  thought), elaborate a bit on your own experience and
	  understanding of how many rounds of trial-error do babies
	  (of any species you have had a chance to observe) require at
	  minimum to acquire advanced skills such as communication or
	  mobility: dozens, hundreds, thousands, millions? Does the
	  amount seem to depend on the complexity of the skill? List
	  at least three different skills along with your gut feeling
	  on how much practice it takes to develop to an acceptable
	  level.
	</p>
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:	
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Classification</li>
	    <li>Linearly separable</li>
	    <li>Vector</li>
	    <li>Inner product</li>
	    <li>Activation function</li>            
	    <li>Error</li>
	    <li>Confusion matrix</li>	  	  
	  </ul>
	</p>	
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	  Should anything be missing or insufficient,

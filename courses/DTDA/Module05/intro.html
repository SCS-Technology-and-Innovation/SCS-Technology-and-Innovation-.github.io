	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  Now that we have graphs, the world is ours. Besides
	  telecommunication networks, roads are an obvious target for
	  our newly-gained skills. Instead of working with a single
	  town, we are now ready to take on a whole province, populate
	  it with towns, and start worrying about the best way to
	  provide connectivity from town to town through a
	  well-thought road network.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:	  	  	  	  
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>adapt a formerly encountered mathematical model to another similar situation</li>
	    <li>employ higher-level graph-theoretical concepts (complete graph, tree, cycle, MST, Hamiltonian cycle, TSP)</li>
	    <li>utilize an (exact, deterministic) algorithm that is <em>efficient</em> (belongs to the class P)</li>
	    <li>utilize an approximation algorithm (for a hard problem that belongs to the class NP)</li>
	    <li>combine the output of two algorithms to craft a "best of both worlds" approach</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  In terms of optimizing the cost and the performance of a
	  road system, multiple considerations will need to be taken
	  into account and quantified in some numerical terms in order
	  to compare whether one option is superior, inferior, or
	  equal to another. Write down, in a brief paragraph, your
	  initial throughts on what some of those criteria could be,
	  in concrete terms: what to measure and in what units to
	  determine how good a proposed road network structure is?
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Path</li>
	    <li>(Spanning) tree</li>
	    <li>Cost</li>	  	  
	    <li>Restriction</li>
	    <li>Cycle</li>
	    <li>Approximation</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	  Should anything be missing or insufficient,
	  please <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://forms.office.com/r/D0pxMvbzsU">report</a> it.

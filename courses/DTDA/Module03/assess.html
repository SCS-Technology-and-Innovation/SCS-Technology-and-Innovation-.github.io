    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Examine the relationship between the overlap that a new antenna
      is allowed to have with existing antennas and the total number
      of antennas by trying out a few combinations, a handful of
      replicas for each combination. Present your results in a table
      and discuss your findings.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Modify the code to assign each antenna a communication radius
      from two or more options, keeping the average of the options the
      same as the original fiuxed radius. Examine with this alters the
      relationship you discovered in the basic stage. Document your
      findings.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Explore
      a <a href="https://www.nperf.com/en/map/CA/6325494.Quebec/-/signal/">cellphone
      coverage map of Quebec (choose a carrier and zoom out) or some
      other website that illustrates cellular network coverage
	overlaid on a map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examine Quebec, Canada, and some other countries and discuss
      your observations, with special attention to any patterns you
      can identify in terms of where the coverage tends to concentrate
      and what you think could be causing that.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about optimization of multiple (two or more) objectives
      (for example
      <a https://codemonk.in/blog/a-gentle-introduction-to-multi-objective-optimization/>this
      blog post</a>) with special attention to
      what <em>scalarization</em> means. What factors can you identify
      that need to be taken into account to choose weights for our two
      objectives (the number of antennas and the total coverage)?

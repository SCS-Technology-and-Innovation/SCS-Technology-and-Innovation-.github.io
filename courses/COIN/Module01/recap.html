	<h1>Recap</h1>
	<p>
	  This course is intended to be the last mandatory course in
	  Graduate Certificate in <em>Data-Driven Decision Making</em>
	  (DDDM). Some students may take in in parallel with CCCS 650
	  or even CCCS 640, which is fine. To make the most of the
	  combination of those three courses that are all mandatory in
	  DDDM, it is best to either follow the sequence in increasing
	  numerical order or by taking the courses simultaneously. We
	  chose not to force a pre-requisite sequence so that students
	  from diverse backgrounds can tailor the experience in a
	  flexible manner, but we do strongly recommend the proposed
	  order of this course being the last, CCCS 640 the first, and
	  CCCS 650 the middle, should a student prefer to study one
	  course at a time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  However, if you skipped 640 or 650, you should manage here
	  just the same. Just please be understanding with your
	  classmates have had more exposure to the tools and concepts
	  that you encounter in the this courses. They may sometimes
	  bring up details on things yet unfamiliar to you; you are
	  encouraged to make ample use of asynchronous learning
	  materials to stay comfortable.
	</p>

	  The first module expands upon the concept of evolutionary
	  algorithms discussed at the end of CCCS 630. If you skipped
	  DACS (since you already had similar knowledge) and started
	  at DDDM, you might benefit from browsing one or more of the
	  following textbooks before attending the first class:

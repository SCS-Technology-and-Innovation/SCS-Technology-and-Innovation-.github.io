	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  When working with the financial data mid-course, we
	  approached the question of forecasting: if we know at least
	  a fragment of the past of a time series, will we be able to
	  predict what the future values might be? This module exposes
	  us to an ambitious mathematical construct called an ARIMA
	  model that does three things at once: attempts to fit a
	  regression on autocorrelations, calculates differences
	  between consecutive values instead of looking at the values
	  as such (possibly more than onces), and observes how model
	  error evolves over time. With the combined (assumed) powers
	  of these three elements, a single-point forecast can be
	  produced. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Not all time series data is equally "predictable". There may
	  be periodic (seasonal) variations, the values may be growing
	  or shrinking over time, and there may be sources of noise,
	  bias, or error in the measurement. The ARIMA model has three
	  parameters that one can adjust to try to counter for such
	  phenomena in the observed data. It is not a simple task,
	  however, to find the best combination.

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Generate artificial time series</li>
	    <li>Examine the effect of seasonality in time series</li>
	    <li>Examine the effect of linear trend in time series</li>
	    <li>Examine the effect of noise in time series</li>
	    <li>Adjust the parameters of a forecasting model</li>
	    <li>Observe prediction error</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  After watching the video, find online a visualization of
	  historial data of a climate-related phenomenon of your
	  choice (options include coastal flooding, polar ice caps,
	  coral reef bleaching, athmospheric gas composition, sea
	  temperatures, crop yield etc.). Sketch on top of the
	  visualization your own attempted forecast of what you think
	  will happen over the next three decades. You do not need to
	  employ any particular method, your best guess is
	  enough. Write down, however, a paragraph or two to describe
	  what in the data makes you think that might be a realistic
	  future.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Forecast</li>
	    <li>Trend</li>
	    <li>Seasonal</li>
	    <li>Autoregression</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>	
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	  Should anything be missing or insufficient,
	  please <a target="_blank"

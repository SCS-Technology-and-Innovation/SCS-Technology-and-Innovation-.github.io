    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Modify the example code to accomodate a second product (such as
      bottled orange juice) from the same manufacturer and model the
      related capacity constraints (a fridge). Assume that the
      delivery cost covers both products as long as they are ordered
      simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examine possible restocking strategies (order when either
      product is low on stock, order when at least one product is low
      on stock, or order only when both are low). Show your code,
      visualize the results, and discuss your findings in writing.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Combine the multi-objective approach from the case study with
      cars and the inventory-management problem from this week to
      explore good combinations for three of more adjustable
      attributes such as the cost of the product, the capacity of the
      oven and the freezer, or the maximum lead time (maybe another
      provided can deliver faster).

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Search for survey articles
      on <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> or
      another online scientific repository on inventory management
      under uncertainty. Pick at least one and skim through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our in-class example, the demand and the lead time were
      assumed to be uncertain, whereas other aspects were assumed
      constant. Reflect in writing, based on what you read and what you can
      deduce on your own, on what other aspects would in the real world be
      uncertain and how we could adjust the model to take that into
      account. Discuss also potential elements that are absent from our
      in-class model but would enrich the realism of the model, should they
      be incorporated into it.
    </p>

      Remember to clearly cite your sources and share resources with
      classmates.

    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Managing the inventory at a store is but a small fraction of the
      larger picture of the supply network that consists of the
      producers of raw materials, the manufacturers of the refined
      commodity, any intermediate storage facilities for either the
      materials, intermediate stages of the products, or the final
      products themselves, and the methods of transport that move
      goods from one location to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browse some additional scientific literature on supply networks and
      draw (either by hand or on a computer) your own diagram of the
      relevant elements you can identify and the relationships between those
      elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to clearly cite all sources. Identify in particular any
      images you used as inspiration for your own diagram and any tools you
      used in preparing the diagram. It is crucial that you submit an
      original illustration that you prepared yourself, not a copy, a
      reproduction, or an adaptation of an existing illustration.

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  At a hair salon, not everyone is equally proficient at
	  braiding or dyeing. A service type at which differences in
	  skills and competencies of those who serve clients is even
	  more delicate is healthcare: not all medical doctors are
	  experts in all things human, but instead have a set of
	  specializations on which they are providing
	  consultation. This setup poses us with a <em>matching
	  problem</em>: when presented with various patients and
	  doctors, if we have prior knowledge of patient needs and
	  doctor skills, which doctor should see which patient,
	  assuming that the capacity of each doctor is limited that
	  day / week / month / whichever horizon of planning we
	  operate on?
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Solve a matching problem</li>
	    <li>Represent relations with adjacency matrices</li>
	    <li>Represent a matching problem as a network flow</li>
	    <li>Create bipartite mappings to represent restrictions</li>
	    <li>Define performance measures for proposed matchings </li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  For context, let's first view
	  <a target="_blank"

	</p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  In an ideal world, every patient could see a doctor the
	  moment they walk into a clinic. Make a brief list of
	  limiting factors that you can think of that make this
	  unrealistic. Briefly discuss what are the scarce resources
	  that need to be controlled and what kinds of processes need
	  to be set in place to carry out such control over which
	  patient gets to see which doctor when not everyone can be
	  attended to on the spot.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:	
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Constraint (restriction)</li>
	    <li>Matching</li>
	    <li>Network (graph)</li>
	    <li>Flow</li>
	    <li>Objective</li>
	    <li>Algorithm</li>
	  </ul>
    	</p>	
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	  Should anything be missing or insufficient,
	  please <a target="_blank"

	alt="Hey, how's it hanging? I wrote a piece of code to calculate how many times each word appears in each forum post. Do you think we could use that to improve our spam-classifier? Cheers, Robin.">

	<p>
	  Robin was bored over the weekend and so decided to write
	  some more software to help moderate the discussion
	  board. The results of Robin’s calculations provide you with
	  additional data. But you are worried about accommodating the
	  word-counts in the training model. The authors of the posts
	  are multilingual, and their posts include many sentences,
	  which can also include both conjugation and spelling errors.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Review some scientific literature on multi-layer neural
	  networks in which each layer contains one or more
	  perceptron(s) and discuss how that might help in this
	  situation. Combine writing, diagrams, and pseudocode as
	  needed in your response, and remember to clearly cite all
	  your sources.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Review some scientific literature on dimensionality
	  reduction and discuss possible ways of applying it to this
	  situation. Combine writing, diagrams, and pseudocode as
	  needed in your response, and remember to clearly cite all
	  your sources.
    </p>    
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Review some scientific literature on neural networks and put
	  together some rough guidelines for training one if you need
	  it. What kind of circumstances would not be ideal for this
	  kind of approach? Remember to clearly cite all your sources.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Once you have completed your guidelines, read online about
	  <em>deep learning</em>, and discuss how it differs from
	  (vanilla) neural networks. Remember to clearly cite all your
	  sources.

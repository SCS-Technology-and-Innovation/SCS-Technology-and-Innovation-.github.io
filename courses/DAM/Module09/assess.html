    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Document a (realistic but potentially imaginary) scenario and
      use the simulator to examine under which parameter values, if
      any, would it be financially sound to install solar panels in
      that scenario. After how many months would it become profitable?
      Record your assumptions, steps, and results.
    </p>
    
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Systematically vary the different parameters to establish how
      sensitive the results are to variations in the values. Also test
      varying in the location by repeating the calculations with different
      data sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Report in writing, possibly with tables or figures to represent
      your findings, what you find to be the key decisions for whether
      solar panels are a good investment and which of the factors
      appear to be more marginal in effect.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Examine prices and properties of solar panels available for
      purchase in your area as well as the costs related to their
      installation and maintanance. Also, look into what happens in
      practice if such a system is capable of producing excess energy:
      what are the costs involved in feeding in into the grid? Would
      installlng a home battery be a good option? If so, under what
      circumstances and what would be the costs involved in such a
      setup?
    </p>
    <p>
      Report all your findings in writing while citing all of the sources you consult.
    </p>
    
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read the scientific
      study <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106023">DOI
      10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106023</a> and draft a similar table on
      how you, intuitively, consider the studied factors to affect
      your own household consumptions. Think of additional measurable
      factors that would also be potentially significant for your own
      scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Document the thought process and its results in writing, clearly
      citing any additional sources you consult while working on the
      assignment.

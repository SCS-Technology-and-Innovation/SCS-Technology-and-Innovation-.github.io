	<h1>Scenario A</h1>
	<p>
	  The roads in your hometown are in poor condition, and budget
	  limitations on repairs, as well as lack of staff and
	  machinery, are making it hard to carry out all the repairs
	  at once. Even finding out where repairs are needed is a
	  problem. Riding around town looking for potholes is not
	  efficient, and relying on volunteer residents to report
	  potholes tends to produce biased claims about which holes
	  should be prioritized.

	<p>
	  You have an idea for a road-monitoring project. A small fleet of
	  municipal vehicles, such as park maintenance vehicles and garbage
	  trucks, is at your disposal. Postal delivery vehicles might also be
	  available. You could equip these vehicles with a device that would
	  gather data about the condition of the pavement and then feed the data
	  into a semi-automated decision-support system. This system would
	  advise on where and when to send pavement repair teams to fix potholes
	  and cracks before anyone gets hurt.
	</p>
	<h1>Phase 1</h1>
	<img width="400" src="https://github.com/SCS-Technology-and-Innovation/DDDM/blob/main/COIN/scenarios/phone01.png?raw=true" alt="Morning, team. We've gotten some complaints about the garbage trucks not picking up the garbage when passing while the truck was actually on its way to someplace else and not on route for pick-up. Could we work on updating the routes to minimize the chances of this happening?">
	<p>
	  Week after week, while trying to keep up with an
	  ever-increasing workload, you keep thinking about your
	  road-monitoring idea. Is there a way you can turn your idea
	  into a concrete plan while also delivering solutions to the
	  immediate needs that will satisfy your superiors?
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
	<h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Propose a metaheuristic that will create weekly routes for a fleet of
	  <em>k</em> vehicles that avoid transiting on streets where vehicles do
	  <strong>not</strong> have designated pick-ups. It is
	  preferable for vehicles to only use routes where they have
	  pickups as much as possible. Sketch out a constructive phase
	  for a feasible initial solution and a local-search phase for
	  improved optimality.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You do not have to implement anything in code (unless you really want
	  to). You can use either text or pseudocode (or a combination of both)
	  to describe your proposal.
	</p>
	<h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Explore and discuss possible <em>performance measures</em>
	  for assessing whether the routes that the heuristic can
	  produce are any good.
	  </p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>

	<h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Browse through a few chapters of
	  <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1128">Smart
	    Delivery Systems: Solving Complex Vehicle Routing
	  Problems</a>.  Come up with a list of about a dozen terms
	  that seem frequent or fundamental to formulating
	  vehicle-fleet routing problems. Start by loosely defining
	  the terms in your own words.
	</p>
	<h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Once you have completed your definitions, take a look at
	  <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1226532200">Green
	  Transportation and New Advances in Vehicle Routing
	  Problems</a>. Compile a brief list of any additional aspects
	  (additional, modified objectives or restrictions) relevant
	  to the formulation of a vehicle-fleet routing problem while
	  taking sustainability into consideration.

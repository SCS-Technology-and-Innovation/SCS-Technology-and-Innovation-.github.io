	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  We have thus far encountered propagation of sorts: the
	  synchronization of the oscillators in Module 9, the spread
	  of an infection in an epidemic model in Module 10, and in
	  some sense also the percolation in Module 11. This time, we
	  the propagation will be an actual <em>displacement</em> of a
	  substance (whether concrete or abstract) through a network
	  model. There is a single <strong>source</strong> from which
	  said substance originates (that is, enters our system) and a
	  single <strong>sink</strong> into which the sustance is
	  headed (an exit point). The substance must <em>flow</em>
	  along the edges of the graph. It is not permitted to
	  accumulate in the intermediate vertices and each edge has a
	  specific (possibly distinct) capacity that limits the number
	  of units of the substance that can traverse that particular
	  edge. Substance can neither vanish at any vertex other than
	  the sink nor can appear at any vertex other than the source,
	  so there are laws of physics to respect at all
	  times. Luckily there is an efficient algorithm for this
	  problem that we can employ to arrive at an optimal solution
	  that maximizes the total flow from the sink to the source,
	  respecting the restrictions set on how the flow may proceed.

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Objectives</h2>
	<p>
	  In this module, you will have an opportunity to...
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>... create uniform random graphs</li>
	    <li>... orient an undirected graph into a directed graph</li>
	    <li>... assign and visualize edge weights</li>
	    <li>... access data stored in sets and dictionaries</li>
	  </ul>
	  Again we also build upon previously gained competencies by
	  altering graph layouts and filtering information.
	</p>

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	</p>
	<ul class="flex-horizontal border-none">
	  <li>directed graph</li>
	  <li>edge capacity</li>

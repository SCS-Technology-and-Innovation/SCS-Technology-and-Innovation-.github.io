	  After reading the text above, you think to yourself <em>Yes,
	    I could use the money</em>. Reflecting upon the offer, you see that it
	  would not take a lot of your time to create a few videos here and
	  there, as per the text message. But you’re hesitant to respond to the
	  text message as it may bring about an ethical dilemma. You would be
	  using free online tools for the task(s) at hand. However, do you have
	  any copyright or any other rights in terms content use and production?
	  Can you charge someone for something you put up using tools that you
	  do not own? Do you need to pay royalties if you use free tools for
	  commercial purposes? Should you maybe charge them for having you train
	  their staff instead?

    <h3>Basic stage of the concluding assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Explore online sources on copyright and privacy
	  issues. Produce a brief set of guidelines and a list of
	  resources about current applicable laws, policies, and
	  regulations regarding privacy, digital copyright, and
	  application of AI technology in the workplace. You can
	  combine writing and diagrams to document your
	  findings. Remember to clearly cite all your sources.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage of the concluding assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Once you have completed your guidelines and list of
	  resources, investigate ongoing processes, debates, and
	  initiatives for reforming existing laws, policies, and
	  regulations (locally, nationally, or internationally) that
	  may affect any of the above-mentioned areas in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Summarize, in writing, your feelings about what types of changes can
	  be expected, and when they can be expected. Remember to clearly cite
	  all your sources.

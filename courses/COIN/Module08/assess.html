	  Using natural language processing, you have gone beyond
	  simply counting string occurrences. Conjugation and spelling
	  are no longer issues. You are even considering automatically
	  translating all the posts into (poorly written) English for
	  the purpose of spam detection.
	  </p>
	
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Using a computational tool of your choice (the Python
	  template from class is just fine), carry out stemming and
	  stop-word removal for a text of your choice. Prepare a word
	  cloud in which each (stemmed) word is drawn at a font size
	  that is proportional to its frequency within the
	  text. Provide your code, discuss the process in writing, and
	  include an image of your word cloud in your response.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Label the words into three sentiment classes—positive,
	  negative, or neutral—based on a lexicon of your
	  choice. Modify your word cloud from the basic stage to
	  colour each term according to its sentiment.
    </p>    
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Review some scientific literature on the use of natural
	  language processing in hate-speech detection and then
	  discuss, in writing, the benefits and risks of relying on a
	  computational tool to censor hate speech. Remember to
	  clearly cite all your sources.
	</p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Once you have completed this task, look into the methods
	  used for automated translation. Discuss possible future
	  AI-assisted language technology applications that are not
	  yet widely in use.

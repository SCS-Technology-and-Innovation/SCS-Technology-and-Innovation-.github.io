    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about multivariate linear regression and play with
      <a href="https://www.zweigmedia.com/RealWorld/multlinreg.html">this
      online tool</a> to see how it works for two to four input
      variables. Note that these are assumed to be quantities, so you
      could experiment with the number of bedrooms, the number of
      bathrooms, and the living area in square feet, for example.
    </p>
	<h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Experimenting either with the in-class example or a
      computational tool of your choice (Python and JavaScript are
      both fine, and R is another fine choice for this), look into how
      to fix a situation in which the scatter plot of the horizontal
      variable versus the vertical one does not form a straight line
      but instead a well-behaved curve of some sort (such as plotting
      the height of a person against their weight, which is a
      non-linear relationship).
    </p>
    <p>
      Document your experiments and findings in writing with
      screenshots, including any code you might have used and all
      references.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hint: the trick is called a <em>transformation</em> and it needs to be a
      mathematical function that has a known inverse (for taking a
      square root, the inverse would be taking the square, whereas for
      taking a logarithm, the inverse would be exponentiation). You
      can read more about this if you are interested in how the math
      behind it works.
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Experiment with how adding more rows of data affects the way the
      model fits the data and the recommendation it gives to a value
      consulted.  Read about linear regression and interpolation and
      reflect upon how what the class example is doing in terms of
      those two concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens if you consult values that are outside of the range
      of the observations? Look into the concept of extrapolation and
      discuss.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about multivariate regression and identify how it differs
      from the simple linear regression we worked with in the class
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look into how to include qualitative information such as the
      neighborhood or the type of lodging (house, condo, etc.) into a
      multivariate linear regression model. Summarize your findings in
      your own words. Remember to clearly cite all sources.

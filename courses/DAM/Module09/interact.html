    <h1>Where the sun does shine</h1>
    <h2>Solar panel installation</h2>
    <p>
      HydroQuebec has
      a <a href="https://www.hydroquebec.com/solar/costs.html">calculator</a>
      much like the one we are working on.  Ours differs from their in
      the sense that we are using weather data and simulated
      consumption data in our calculations.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Cost of electricity</h3>
    
    <P>The cost of electricity depends on the total daily consumption
      (see <a href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-commodities/electricity/report/canadian-residential-electricity-bill/quebec.html">Canada
      Energy Regulator</a> for additional details): consumption
      exceeding a threshold is billed at a higher rate. We assume in
      this simulator that excess energy produced is sold to the grid
      at the cost associated to regular consumption (note that this
      not actually how it works in practice; credits are issued
      instead and there are fixed costs involved). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Threshold between regular and high consumption:
      <input type="number" min="0" step="5" id="threshold" value="40">
      <small>(as kWh per day)</small>           
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Cost of regular consumption:
      <input type="number" min="0" max="100" step="1" id="regular" value="6.08">
      <small>(as Canadian cents per kWh)</small>           
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Cost of excess consumption:
      <input type="number" min="0" max="100" step="1" id="excess" value="9.38">
      <small>(as Canadian cents per kWh)</small>           
    </p>
    
    <h3>Panel properties</h3>
    
    <p>
      Instead of computing the
      global <a href="https://help.valentin-software.com/pvsol/en/calculation/irradiation/irradiation-onto-inclined-plane/">irradiation
	onto an inclined plane</a>, we simplify and only work with
      direct radiation. In reality, the radiation arriving at the
      panel surface would also
      include <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme812/node/644">reflected
	and diffuse radiation</a> so it would be somewhat higher than
      estimated in these calculations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Number of panels:
      <input type="number" min="0" step="5" id="count" value="5">
    </p>
    <p>
      Surface area of each individual panel:
      <input type="number" min="1" id="surface" value="1.64">
      <small>(in square meters)</small>
    </p>
    <p>
      Panel inclination:
      <input type="number" min="0" max="180" step="5" id="angle" value="10">
      <small>(elevation angle from horizontal in degrees)</small>           
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversion effiency:
      <input type="number" min="0" max="100" step="2" id="eff" value="20">
      <small>(as a percentage)</small>     
    </p>
    <p>
      Panel lifetime
      <input type="number" min="5" max="50" step="5" id="lifetime" value="20">
      <small>(in years)</small>     
    </p>
    
    <h3>System costs</h3>
    <p>
      Purchase cost of each individual panel:
      <input type="number" min="100" id="price" value="800">
  <small>(in CAD)</small>
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial installation cost:
      <input type="number" min="100" id="install" value="500">
      <small>(in CAD for the whole system)</small>
    </p>
    <p>
      System maintenance cost:
      <input type="number" min="100" max="1500" step="10" id="maintain" value="300">
      <small>(in CAD)</small>     
    </p>
    
    <p>
      System maintenance interval:
      <input type="number" min="6" max="36" step="6" id="interval" value="12">
      <small>(in months)</small>     
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Probability of snow removal:
      <input type="number" min="0" max="100" step="10" id="snow" value="50">
      <small>(as a percentage)</small>     
    </p>
    
    <h3>Consumption</h3>
    <p>
      The kWh consumed by a household
      to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106023">depends on
	the weather, the time of day, and the month</a>, among other
      factors. We work with a simplified model, very loosely based on the
      findings of the Irish study linked above:
      <ul>
	<li>The higher the temperature, the less energy is consumed: -X% per Celsius when above a threshold.</li>
	<li>When it rains or snows, Y% more energy is consumed.</li>
	<li>Wind does not affect energy consumption.</li>
	<li>Consumption between March and October (Spring, Summer, and Fall) is Z% lower than
	  between November and February (Winter).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We use binary indicators for whether it is raining (no/yes) and
      snowing (yes/no), for simplicity,
      although <a href="https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Engineer_Climate/CWEEDS_FMCEG/CWEEDS_FMCEG_v_2020/CWEEDS-FMCEG_by_par_prov.CSV/readme.pdf">the
	data itself contains more precise information</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Value for X
      <input type="number" min="0" max="10" step="1" id="xval" value="1">
      <small>(see the above list for what X stands for)</small>     
    </p>
    <p>
      Value for Y
      <input type="number" min="0" max="10" step="1" id="yval" value="4">
      <small>(see the above list for what Y stands for)</small>     
    </p>
    <p>
      Value for Z
      <input type="number" min="0" max="10" step="1" id="zval" value="3">
      <small>(see the above list for what Z stands for)</small>     
    </p>
    <p>
      Temperature threshold
      <input type="number" min="0" max="50" step="5" id="temp" value="15">
      <small>(in Celsius)</small>     
    </p>
    <p>
      Mean household consumption
      <input type="number" min="0.8" max="2.2" step="0.1" id="cons" value="1.5">
      <small>(in kWh during the winter)</small>     
    </p>
    <p>
      Standard deviation for household consumption
      <input type="number" min="0.0" max="1.0" step="0.1" id="sd" value="0.2">
      <small>(in kWh, assuming normal distribution)</small>     
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Irish model distinguises between times of day (eight
      periods), our simplified model ignores these nuances. By using times
      of day, their model is also able to distinguish between workdays,
      weekends, and holidays, which we also ignore.

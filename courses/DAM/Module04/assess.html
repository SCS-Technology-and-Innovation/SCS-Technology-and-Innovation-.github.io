    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    
    
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>

    <p>
      Interacting with the model and solution method studied in class,
      examine systematically how the following factors appear to
      affect the percentage of appointments that are successfully
      scheduled:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Number of patients</li>
      <li>Average number of appointments per patient</li>
      <li>Probability of doctor availability</li>
      <li>Probability of equipment availabiility</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Explain first the methodology you have designed for your
      systematic examination, then report your results, and conclude
      with an interpretation of the results.
      </p>

    
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>

    <p>
      What other factors are there that also appear to affect the
      percentage of appointments scheduled?  Draft some guidelines on
      how one could attempt to map out such dependencies between
      adjustable parameters and the characteristics of the resulting
      solution.
      </p>
    <p>
      Apply your guidelines to this scenario and report your findings.
      Include both the guidelines and the findings in clear writing in your
      response.

    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>

    
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>

    <p>
      How can one deduce actionable insights on the following aspects using a model like the one studied in class?
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Which equipment is lacking and where?</li>
      <li>Which room types are too abundant or scarce?</li>
      <li>Which doctors are not available often enough to provide enough patient care?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Skim over the
      article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.05.004">DOI
      10.1016/j.ejor.2021.05.004</a> to make your best guess (try not
      to worry about unfamiliar terms this time, there may be too
      many) on
      <ol>
      <li>what in are the "resource constraints" in our
	example model we studied in class, and,</li>
      <li>what kind of "temporal
      constraints" could we incorporate to replace or enhance the
	concept of <em>priority</em> in our model?</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>

    <p>
      Experiment with the model studied in class to determine how many
      patients, methods, and doctors (use the same number of all three
      parameters for simplicity) you can add before the visualization
      becomes illegible. Then, continue adding more until the
      calculation of the assignment starts to feel slow.
      </p>
    <p>
      Once you notice that it is taking time to make the calculation,
      find something to measure time (a clock on the computer or a
      stopwatch on your phone). Pick five different parameter values
      (patient/method/doctor counts) at which the calculation is slow
      but not impossibly so (meaning that it takes more than a second
      but not more than a minute, at most, depending on how patient
      you are). Then, run the calculation five times for random data
      for each of those parameter values and measure how long it
      took. Report these 25 measurements in a table of your own design
      and discuss your findings.
      </p>
    
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>

    <p>
      Craft of a way to visually represent the data in the table you
      prepared in the basic stage in some sort of a plot. Prepare the
      graphic either by computer with the tool of your choice or by
      hand (if you draw on paper, include a photograph of the drawing
      in your response).
    </p>
    <p>
      Discuss whether the visualization is helping you to gain more
      insight into what is happening with the model and the algorithm
      that we are using to solve the problem.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>

    <p>
      Start by casually reading
      these <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/msande111/notes/chapter5.pdf">lecture
	notes from Stanford</a> (or similar; try not to stop at unfamiliar
      terms or notations, make your best guess and keep going).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, attempt to draft equations like those of the notes for the
      model we studied in class. For any symbol you use, write down
      your best understanding of what it stands for. There is no need
      to be formal or correct, the goal is simply to attempt to bridge
      what we saw in class with what is written in the lecture notes
      and identify the weak spots in your understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Document your process and end result in writing and with drawings
      where applicable.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>

    <p>
      Read the
      article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-006-0002-4">DOI
      10.1007/s10729-006-0002-4</a> (or a similar one of your choice)
      that applies a network flow model to an applied problem. Search
      for similarities between the proposed model and our own model we
      studied in class. Document the similarities as well as any
      differences you spot in writing. It may be helpful to use
      diagrams as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to write everything in your own words and to make your
      own diagrams instead of reusing those of the sources that you
      cite. Yet, keep in mind that you must cite the sources properly
      even when you do not in fact copy anything directly from them.

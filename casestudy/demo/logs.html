    Coming here downloaded a dataset into your downloads
    folder. Please use that file in your assessment. The file is
    called <code>forumlog-*.csv</code> where in place of the * there is
    a timestamp. If you already had a file of that name, any new
    download of the file results in a filename
    like <code>forumlog-*(1).csv</code>. If you do not see such a file,
    reload this page.

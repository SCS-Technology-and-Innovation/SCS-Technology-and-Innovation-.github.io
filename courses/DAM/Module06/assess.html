      <li>Play around with the <a target="_blank" href="interact.html">interactive
	part</a> to try to formulate some <strong>rules of
	thumb</strong> for when to buy and when to sell. Try to
	express your rules in writing, possibly supported by
	diagrams.</li>
      <li>Then, download new data that is <em>different</em> from the
      one you used to establish your rules. Try investing based on
      your rules and write down the outcome.</li>
      <li>
	Discuss in writing how your rules performed on the new data
	and whether you thought of any changes to your rules based
	your experience.

      Remember to cite all your sources. You can again enrich your

    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Look into <em>automated</em> trading simulators and tools,
      whether AI-based or rule-based (be very careful not to create
      accounts on any websites that might be malicious or to download
      any potential malware).
      See if you could reproduce your rules in some shape or form
      within such tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Document your experience in writing with screenshots. The
      process matters more than the results.
    </p>

      If you've already taken CCCS 610 or are otherwise familiar with
      Python, you can even poke around creating a trading bot (see for
      example this

	bot from tutorial</a>).

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      When buying stock, one needs to not only contemplate what the
      stock costs, but also the <strong>risk</strong> involved in that
      particular stock. Look into how to <em>quantify</em> risk in
      this context (you can start for example
      at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/calculating-risk-reward.asp">Investopedia</a>)
      and take notes of your findings.  </p>
    <p>
      Based on the notes, your thoughts, and possibly some exploration
      with the <a target="_blank" href="interact.html">interactive example</a>, put in
      writing (in your own words) some guidelines on how to deal with
      risk when making buy-sell decisions of stocks.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Stock portfolio optimization</em> refers to picking which
      combination of stocks (which ones and how many of each) should
      an indvidual own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that you own stocks of more than one company.
      investigate and speculate upon whether buy-sell decisions should
      be based on the properties of the <em>individual</em> stocks,
      correlations or other pairwise properties of the stocks within
      your portfolio, or something that involves three or more
      different stocks from your portfolio.
      </p>
    <p>
      Combine reading and independent data exploration. Remember to
      cite all sources in your response.

    Coming here downloaded a dataset into your downloads
    folder. Please use that file to answer the quiz question. The file
    is called <code>casestudyX.csv</code>, where <code>X</code> is the
    number mentioned in your quiz question. If you already had a file
    of that name, any new download of the file results in a filename
    like <code>casestudyX(1).csv</code>. If you do not see such a
    file, reload this page. Erasing those data files between quiz
    attempts is the easiest way to avoid using the wrong data by
    accident. Use the back button of the browser to return to the quiz
    questions.

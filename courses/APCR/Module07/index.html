	<h1>Prototyping</h1>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	  It is of course possible for one to make a neat contribution
	  to applied computational research without a single line of
	  program code. However, it is rare.  
	</p>
	<p>
	  Whatever analysis, processing, calculation, simulation or
	  visualization we make for our work is already in itself a
	  contribution. Building it into a clear, coherent,
	  self-sufficient piece of software makes it easier for us
	  ourselves to make edits and improvements, execute replicas,
	  and to build upon our own work. Furthermore, if we share
	  these codes with the community (which we will work on in a
	  future module), science can take bigger and faster leaps as
	  we avoid reinventing the wheel day in, day out. One the
	  lowest learning-curve tools for this purpose in the present
	  day is Python; it is widely known, accepted, and appreciated
	  in the scientific community. In this module, we will
	  prototype a bit in Python to get the ball rolling.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	</p>	
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Leverage program code to automate research steps</li>
	  <li>Combine elements from existing libraries to quickly
	  develop functionality</li>
	  <li>Employ clear and documented code as a means for
	  reproducible research</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Readings</h2>
	<p>
	  Any online resource for Python 3 is fine. The McGill Library
	  contains various ebooks that may be helpful:
	<ul class="flex-horizontal border-none">
	  <li>Nelli: Python data analytics
	    <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1126570326">https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1126570326</a></li>
	  <li>Molin: Hands-on data analysis with Pandas

	</ul>	
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Tools</h2>
	<p>
	  You can either install Python on your computer by
	  downloading a software such as
	  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">IDLE</a> or use
	  Python
	  in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a>. Either
	  option works just as well and the former does not require
	  you to create any online accounts.
	</p>
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Assessment: prototyping</h2>
	<p>
	  <strong>Submission deadline</strong>: by Session 8.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>Submitted material</strong>: a single PDF file
	  containing either the Python code as a syntax-highlighted
	  printout or a URL of a publicly readable Colab sheet (the
	  latter option is easier, but requires a third-party account,
	  for which the use of Colab is optional), followed by the
	  self/peer assessments in writing, if applicable.
	</p>
	<h3>Basic stage (up to 5 pts)</h3>
	<p>
	  First draft of computational implementation. Remember to
	  clearly indicate any parts of the code that are based on an
	  existing source (start, end, source, what is
	  modified). Reuse and modification of code is allowed but
	  must be clearly documented.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>Rubric</strong>
	  <ol>
	    <li><em>Quality and functionality</em> of code &mdash;
	    amount, sophistication, originality; all on a scale of 0
	    (insufficent) or 1 (adequate)</li>
	    <li><em>Self assessment</em>: what is good and what is missing in
	    your own prototype at present? (0 = none, 1 = actionable
	      insight)</li>
	    <li><em>Peer assessment</em>: what is good and what is
	    sorely missing in another participants (please identify
	    clearly whose work you assess) prototype?  (0 = none, 1 =
	    actionable insight)</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	<h3>In-depth stage (up to 3 pts)</h3>
	<p>
	  Include additional comments in your code that facilitate
	  legibility and reproducibility. Each helpful (non-evident,
	  yet clear) commented block of functionality gives one point,
	  up to a maximum of three total.

	<h1>Scenario A, phase 4</h1>
	<img src="https://github.com/SCS-Technology-and-Innovation/DDDM/blob/main/COIN/scenarios/phone04.png?raw=true" alt="Kitchen fridge unusable, again! We need a large space there for Marion's birthday cake tomorrow first thing, but it's stuffed will all kinds of mouldy Tupperware. Please go clean out your things ASAP." width="400">
	<P>
	  You finally obtained a set of tablets that drivers can take
	  along on their routes. They will use the tablets to record
	  vehicle vibrations and to store the data along with GPS
	  coordinates. This has allowed you to start gathering data
	  for your road-repair plan.
	</P>
	<p>
	  However, you have noticed that the same three drivers keep
	  taking the tablets along the same routes. As a result, your data is
	  not very diverse. You discover that the morning shift team likes to
	  use the tablets to participate in multiplayer games during their
	  breaks, so they take off with the tablets before anyone else even
	  clocks in. The text message you received about the fridge adds to your
	  concerns about the drivers’ ability to share and self-organize.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You have asked around and are keen to help, but the tablets
	  are simply not available. You can’t afford any more tablets,
	  and you would prefer not having to implement an
	  equipment-booking system since it could discourage
	  volunteers.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option, basic stage</h2>
	<p>
	  Read about the <em>tragedy of the commons</em> (independent
	  research) and reflect, in writing, on how this is related to
	  the problem with the tablets as well as the state of the
	  breakroom fridge. Try to draft some solutions that will
	  solve the problem without antagonizing anyone.
	</p>

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option, basic stage</h2>

	<p>
	  Read about the <em>airport problem</em> (independent
	  research) and use the <strong>Shapley value</strong> to
	  calculate the costs for an example of your
	  own. <span style="color:red">(Do not use the values in
	  Wikipedia or on any other website; pick your own.)</span>
	</p>

	<h2 class="topic-heading">In-depth stage for <em>both</em> options</h2>
	<p>
	  Read about <em>Nash equilibrium</em> (independent research)
	  and its applications in a domain of your choice (finance,
	  healthcare, traffic, etc.). Document your findings in
	  writing, calculations, or code.

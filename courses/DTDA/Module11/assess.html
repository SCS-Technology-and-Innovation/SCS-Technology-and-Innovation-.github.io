    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Pick two other graph generation models from the options
      available in the networkx library. Create graphs with the three
      models (the one in the example code and the two of your choice)
      of similar order and size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiment on how quickly the three kinds of graph break into
      one or more components and how quickly the order of the largest
      component decreases as vertices are removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider two different options for vertex removal: either
      uniformly at random (like in the example code) or preferentially
      to their degree (the probability of removal being proportional
      to the vertex degree, in such a way that the higher the vertex
      degree, the greater the probability of removal).
    </p>
    <p>
      Document your findings in writing and show your code.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Modify the example code to remove <em>edges</em> one by one instead of vertices. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, modify the code of your basic stage further to also remove
      any vertex that no longer has any neighbors at all (that is,
      after it's final edge has been removed).
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the way in which the network breaks down and discuss if
      you can see any qualitative differences to how it behaved when
      vertices being removed.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about the concept of critical infrastructure. Summarize in
      writing the kinds of critical infrastructure you encounter. For
      each, discuss your findings and your intuition on how to model
      and measure the robustness of those kinds of infrastructure
      against random failure as well as their resilience against
      deliberate acts of sabotage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to cite the sources and share findings with classmates, as usual.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Search on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google
      Scholar</a> or in another scientific online repository for
      survey articles on the resilience of graphs. Pick one to skim
      over and write a summary in your own words on the factors and
      the applications that the survey discusses, with special focus
      on how (in terms of what property) resilience is quantified.

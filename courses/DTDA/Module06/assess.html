    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Identify a phenomenon that one can visually observe (such as a
      plant infestation, a crack on a concrete surface, a mole on
      skin, the number of chocolate chips in a cookie, anything that
      catches your attention).
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a photograph or pick one that is posted online under a licence
      that permits non-commercial reuse with modifications (always be sure
      to respect the privacy and copyrights of others).
    </p>
    <p>
      Use steps similar to those of the example code to highlight in
      some way the phenomenon of interest in your input image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Show your code, the input image, the intermediate images, and
      the end result, along with a brief written description of your
      reasoning for the process and how satisfied you are with the
      result.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Investigate tools (either within Python or independent ones) for
      creating animated GIFs. Create an animation that show the stages
      of the image evolution either for the stages of the example code
      or for the process you implemented in the basic stage. Learn to
      control the speed at which the animation proceeds, the size of
      the animated image, and whether or not it loops after reaching
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Include in your response the steps required to build the
      animation and the resulting GIF.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      First, read about or watch videos about the potential of
      computational analysis of satellite imagery in monitoring
      phenomena such as 
      <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145988/tracking-amazon-deforestation-from-above">Amazon
      deforestation</a> or
      <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/bulletin/ice-sheet-observations-from-space">ice
      sheet behavior at the poles</a>. Write a paragraph or two in
      your own words to summarize your findings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, look for similar reports or scientific studies regarding the use
      of other aerial imagery (from airplanes, helicopters, or drones, for
      example) for cattle management and agriculture, traffic analysis,
      control and detection of wildfires, and/or urban
      development. Summarize again your findings in writing, emphasizing any
      differences you may have encountered between the first and the second
      type of studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, look into the use of automated image processing for
      industrial quality control (finding bad apples, literally, or
      cracked cookies), medical imagery (MRI scans, analysis of
      X-rays, photos of skin lesions, etc.). Discuss again your
      findings and contrast with those from the first two groups of
      studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember again to cite clearly all sources you consult during
      your research. Please share interesting sources you encounter
      with your fellow students while working on the assignment using
      the MS Team for students; you can acknowledge the contributions
      of your companions in a brief paragraph at the end of our
      response.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about specialized cameras (spectral imagery, hyperspectral
      imagery). Discuss the different variants you find and how these
      technologies differ from regular RGB cameras. In terms of how
      expensive the special cameras are, what applications can you
      think of that would clearly benefit from having a specialized
      camera instead of a regular one?
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to cite all your sources, share resources with your
      companions, and acknowledge their contributions at the end of your
      response.

    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      The height and the width of the tree as a whole are those of its
      root node. Determine systematically the how the width and the
      height of the resulting tree depend on the branching rate and
      the change factor in situations in which the maximum depth and
      the maximum total size are not reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Report in writing
      <ul class="action-items">
	<li>the design for the systematic exploration,</li>
	<li>the data you gather at each step of the exploration,</li>
	<li>the analysis of the gathered data, and</li>
	<li>the conclusions drawn based on the analysis.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you consult any sources in the process, remember to
      clearly cite them clearly.
    </p>
    
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Extend your analysis to the level of individual nodes and
      examine the degree distribution, again in situations in which
      the maximum depth and the maximum total size are not reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this a roughly symmetrical distribution? It is skewed left or
      right? Does it appear to be more or less normal? Is there a
      mathematical name for this particular distribution?
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that you can add a <code>console.log(n.degree);</code> to
      the subroutine that draws the nodes to have these numbers appear
      in the web-developer tool console instead of writing them down
      yourself in case you wish to use a computational tool for the
      analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you consult any sources in the process, remember to clearly cite them clearly.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about real-world branching processes and determine which
      ones "cool down" (change factors below one) and which ones do
      not (change factor roughly equal to one), and which ones "speed
      up" (change factors above one).
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to find at least one example for each of the three
      scenarios, and if you find nothing documented, attempt to
      identify one by thinking about other possible branching
      processes yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to clearly cite any sources you may consult and share
      interesting information with fellow participants.
    </p>
    
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      In our example branching system, new nodes are added but older
      nodes are never removed. A generalization of this model is
      called a birth-death process. In such a process, each node has a
      limited lifetime. Also, each node is born at a specific time and
      the speed of this happening may vary from branch to branch,
      creating a more blurry definition of "generations".
    </p>
    <p>
      Read and think about the possible ways that lifetimes can be
      modelled by considering how and when births and deaths take
      place in diverse kinds of branching processes. Consider also
      non-organic processes: for example, electronic components or
      road pavements have a "useful life". Socioeconomic phenomena as
      well involves the rise and fall of elements (companies get
      founded, merge, split or cease operations).
    </p>
    <p>
      Document your thoughts and findings in writing, clearly citing
      any sources you consulted in the process.

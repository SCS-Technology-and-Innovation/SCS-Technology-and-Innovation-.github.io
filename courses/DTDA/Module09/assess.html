    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Experiment with different quantities of fireflies and different
      values of the perception radius within which the flies sense
      each other. Document your code and report your findings in
      writing and with insightful visualizations.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Experiment with different values of the coupling constant and
      different kinds of noise (additive, symmetrical, none). Document
      your code and report your findings in writing and with
      insightful visualizations.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read a scientific study of your choice on a synchronization
      phenomenon of a biological nature, such as the circadian rhythm
      study https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00011 on human
      subjects. Look for parallels between the study in question and
      our model, such as:
      <ol>
	<li>is it multi-agent or single-entity?</li>
	<li>what is being observed, if anything? is there a range
	of sensation of sorts?</li>
	<lk>is there anything similar to our concept of coupling?
	  if so, what would that be?</li>
<li>is there anything similar to our concept of phase? if so, would
  that be?</li>
<li>how is frequency expressed in the model? in degrees per time unit?
in radians per time unit? in some other way? what is the time unit, if
there is one?</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Remember to clearly cite all sources.
</p>
<h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
<p>
  Look into non-biological phenomena and applications that involve
  synchronization. Summarize three of them in your own words,
  covering aspects similar to those discussed in the basic stage
  of this assessment.
</p>
<p>
  Share with your classmates links to interesting texts and videos
      you encounter while searching. Clearly cite all sources and
  acknowledge contributions from fellow participants.

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  The simulation in the first module was rather simple: one of
	  the elevators arrives and that the entirely of a
	  replica. Most real-world phenomena are a bit more complex
	  than that. This module takes us into the world of queuing
	  theory as we simulate a multi-server multi-client setting: a
	  hair salon. One or more hair dresses have their individual
	  work stations at which they can provide a service to one
	  customer at a time. Customers may choose to wait for their
	  turn in a lounge, but having to wait can lead to churn
	  &mdash; a customer might just walk out without ever getting
	  served. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  A situation of this kind gives rise to many questions of
	  interest: how long do the customers typically need to wait,
	  what proportion of customers are lost to churn, are any of
	  the hair dressers and their work stations idle? Gathering
	  statistics over numerous replicas may again shed light on
	  what to do: how many seats to provide in the lobby, how many
	  hair dresses to employ simultaneously, and how to model
	  service times and customer preferences?
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Objectives</h2>
	<p>
	  In this module, you will have an opportunity to...
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>... simulate a service</li>
	    <li>... adjust the parameters of an arrival process</li>
	    <li>... study the effect of capacity constraints, policies, and preferences</li>
	    <li>... measure and analyze basic performance measures of a queueing model</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>

	<h1>Scenario A, phase 2</h1>

	<img src="https://github.com/SCS-Technology-and-Innovation/DDDM/blob/main/COIN/scenarios/phone02.png?raw=true" width="800" alt="It's been brought to my attention that some drivers feel like they get assigned to routes more often than others, resulting in an inadequate balance in workload. As a bit of bright news, we got tons of positive feedback from parents whose daughters were thrilled to spot Marion driving the garbage truck - could we maybe rotate her on different routes to maximize exposure?">
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
  <p>
    Draft one or more <em>decision trees</em> that use
    route-assignment records from previous weeks to figure out who
    should be assigned which routes next week. Combine (possibly
    iterative) calculations and conditions to formally express your
    proposed rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use a combination of writing, pseudo-code, and diagrams to clearly
    communicate your proposal (leaving no room for interpretation).
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
  <p>
    Add some program code in a computational tool of your choice to
    automate (at least in part) the driver-to-route assignment process
    according to the proposal you described above.
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
  <p>
    To help you conceptualize a solution to this problem, start by
    interacting with
    <a href="tool.html">this Boolean logic evaluation tool</a> until
      you understand how the three basic operators &mdash; $\vee$
      (or), $\wedge$ (and) &amp; $\neg$ (not) &mdash; function. You can
      look up online tutorials on Boolean logic for guidance, such as
    <a href="https://sites.millersville.edu/bikenaga/math-proof/truth-tables/truth-tables.html">Ikenaga's
    explanation</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
  <p>
    Keep at it until you are also able to describe the functionality
    of the additional operators: $\oplus$ (xor), $\rightarrow$
    (implication), $\leftrightarrow$ (equivalence). If you're
    following Ikenaga's explanations, you will need look up xor
    (``exclusive or'') elsewhere (for example
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate">on this Wikipedia
    page</a>).

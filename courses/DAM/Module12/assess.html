    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Based on the in-class discussion of how the AR and MA
      regressions work and what the differentiation does (when
      active), explore the combinations of generation parameters and
      ARIMA parameters to experimentally discover some rules of thumb
      on what seems to work well and what seems to be a horrible idea
      in terms of forecasting precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organize your writings in a report that briefly explains what
      each parameter appears to control and how it seems to interact with
      the other parameters, if at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no need to read any reference materials, but if you run
      out of ideas and need to consult external sources, please cite
      the sources clearly in your report.
    </p>

    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Pen and paper time: either pick a real-world open dataset (for
      example from <a target="_blank"
      href="https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data">open.canada.ca</a>)
      with a time series or just come up with some numbers whichever
      way you please. Pick a small interval of the time series (10 to
      20 data points is perfectly sufficient) and plot it (completely
      by hand, no matter how roughly, or with some computer software
      of your choice).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, mimic step by step the simplied ARIMA process we studied
      in class, with some simple values of the
      parameters <em>p</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>q</em>. Avoid making
      the calculations for the regression lines and instead just draw
      approximate regression lines (freehand) on your plot and on an
      auxiliary plot of the forecast errors you will end up
      making. Note that if you chose a non-zero value of
      <em>d</em>, you should also prepare a difference plot
      separately. Try to carry out at least five forecasts, no matter
      how rough approximates they end up being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Include in your report photos or screenshots of different stages
      of your handicrafted ARIMA. Once you feel that you have
      understood what happens in each step, express that in writing as
      clearly as you can. if you notice that you made a mistake early
      on, no need to start over: just document what happened and
      continue with your new and improved understanding in the steps
      to come.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Consider any three of the the following four hypothetical scenarios and their impact
      on how mathematical forecasting methods might be able to cope with
      such situations. Instead of typing in a search engine, try to just
      think about how the method we studied together worked and what and how
      could be tweaked to adjust for the proposed scenarios.
    </p>
    <ul class="action-items">
      <li>What if the trend changes over time, sometimes slower,
      sometimes faster, or even changes direction altogether from time
      to time?</li>
      <li>What if the noise distribution changes over time, either in
      terms of the values of its parameters (like mean and standard
      deviation) or becomes a different distribution?</li>
      <li>What if there are multiple different seasonalities (daily, weekly,
	monthly, etc.) instead of just one? This is very common in any data
	that associates to human behaviour and/or natural phenomena.</li>
      <li>What if we need to forecast more than one data point into
      the future? What could we do with what we studied in class?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Express your thoughts in writing. If you consulted any sources,
      please cite them clearly, but since this is a thought
      experiment, you are encouraged to just think instead of looking
      things up.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      What kind of forecast methods do climate scientists use to study
      global warming? Find and browse peer-reviewed scientific
      publications. Discuss your findings in writing, with particular
      attention to what kind of seasonalities, sources of noise, and
      trends are present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to clearly cite your sources and share interesting
      findings with other participants.

	<h1>Code repositories</h1>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	  Reproducible scientific reseach relies on all contributors
	  making their the data and the code behind their reported
	  contribution easily identifiable and accessible for all. In
	  this module, you place your own contribution (in its
	  present, possibly partial state) into a publicly accessible
	  repository so that you can refer to it in your writings and
	  presentations.
	</p>	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	</p>	
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Identify options for creating publicly accessible code repositories</li>
	  <li>Create a repository with the option of your choice</li>
	  <li>Upload existing code into a repository</li>
	  <li>Edit files present in a repository</li>
	  <li>Clone (read: copy) a cloud repository on a computer</li>
	  <li>Synchronize a cloud repository with a local copy</li>
	  <li>Document a repository to associate it with your research</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Readings</h2>
	<p>
	  <ul class="flex-horizontal border-none">
	  <li>Guthals:
	  GitHub <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1371441996">https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1371441996</li>
	</ul>	
          <h2 class="topic-heading">Tools</h2>
	<p>
	  The recommended tool
	  is <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> but the
	  participants are free to make their own choice or even host
	  one locally if their technical skills and ambitions match
	  that goal.
	</p>
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Assessment: reproducibility</h2>
	<p>
	  <strong>Submission deadline</strong>: by Session 11.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>Submitted material</strong>: for the hands-on
	  branch, a single PDF file containing the URL of the public
	  repository; for the conceptual branch, a single PDF file
	  containing the written summaries (basic stage) and
	  discussions (in-depth stage).
	</p>
	<h3>Basic stage (up to 5 pts)</h3>
	<p>
	  <em>Hands-on branch</em>: create and populate a repository
	  with your current project progress (rubric: 1 pt for each of
	  the following elements &mdash; creation, including source
	  code, naming conventions, including or referencing data).
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Conceptual branch</em>: look up and summarize guidelines
	  in respected scientific journals regarding the way in which
	  code is to be made available when publishing in those
	  journals (rubric: 1 pt per adequately summarized and
	  referenced guideline).
	</p>	
	<h3>In-depth stage (up to 3 pts)</h3>
	<p>
	  <em>Hands-on branch</em>: include of a <code>README</code>
	  file and a <code>LICENCE</code> file in the repository
	  (rubric: 1 pt per file with adequate base content, 1
	  additional point if the README file properly identifies
	  dependencies with external tools and libraries used in the
	  project).
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Conceptual branch</em>: read about forks and pull
	  requests in Git, then explain the usefulness of each in
	  writing (rubric: 1 pt for adequately describing the purpose
	  of forking, 1 pt for adequately describing the purpose of
	  pull request, 1 pt for a list of two or more references
	  consulted to determine the former).

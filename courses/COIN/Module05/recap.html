	<h1>Recap</h1>
	<p>
	  In CCCS 610, we encountered settings in which individual
	  system elements carried out some choice, change of internal
	  state, movement or action that could affect others or be
	  observed by them (graph coloring, contagion,
	  synchronization). CCCS 630 also delved into agent-based
	  systems in the terrain of computational simulation. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The formulation of a set of rules for a set of such entities
	  (whether pure software or robots of sorts) to follow in
	  order to carry out a collective task is one possible approach
	  to computational intelligence with diverse applications and
	  a lot of math behind it. In addition to "just statistics",
	  there is quite a lot of calculus involved, especially in the
	  form of <em>control theory</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The way in which the entities, commonly referred to
	  as <em>agents</em> make decisions can also rely heavily on
	  the mathematics behind competition and collaboration we
	  explored in Module 4 while venturing into game theory.

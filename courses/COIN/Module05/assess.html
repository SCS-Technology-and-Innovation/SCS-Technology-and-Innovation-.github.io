All six of them are in the storage room and they've been entered into the equipment booking system, however: make sure you complete the mandatory training before attempting to fly one." width="400">
	<p>
	  You placed a request for some drones over a year ago, and
	  they have finally arrived. You and Robin from IT took the
	  training for drone operation as soon as it became available,
	  but nobody else is yet authorized to operate the drones. In
	  addition, you are worried about mid-air collisions due to
	  human error as well as the whole road monitoring project
	  being jeopardized before it even gets started.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Therefore, you are both now planning on creating a piece of
	  software that can operate the drones as a fleet. You want to
	  use this software to fly all the drones simultaneously over
	  the downtown area on Sunday morning, while there isn’t much
	  traffic circulation, to record videos of the road (pavement)
	  conditions. The idea is that you would operate one of the
	  six, and the other five would maintain formation around the
	  one you are controlling.
	</p>
	
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Draft a general set of rules stating how the other five
	  drones should be positioned relative to the lead drone under
	  your control. You want to ensure that there are no gaps in
	  the imagery, that there is little overlap, and that the risk
	  of collision is zero. You can combine writing and diagrams
	  in your response.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Express at least some part of the above rule set in
	  pseudocode and/or program code.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Watch <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/drones-play-james-bond-theme">this
	  group of drones playing the James Bond theme
	  music</a>. Discuss in writing how complex you expect the
	  coordination of the software would have to be to avoid the
	  drones crashing and to ensure the music produced was
	  reasonably accurate.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Read news articles and watch videos,
	  <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/drone-light-show-fireworks-canada-day-1.6886497">such
	  as this one</a>, about drones being used as replacements for
	  fireworks. Think about the differences between “flying in
	  formation” and collaborative tasks like ants working
	  together to cross a gap. An example
	  is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_mNC81fnyY">this
	  viral news story of an attack on a wasp’s nest</a>.  Clearly
	  citing your sources, discuss in writing what kinds of
	  utility tasks, beyond entertainment, could be envisioned for
	  swarms of drones.

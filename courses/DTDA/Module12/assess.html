    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Modify the example code so that edges are no longer directed but
      instead undirected (like pipes in which liquid flows); this
      means that the flow along an edge may proceed in one direction
      or the other, but not both. Verify that the algorithm still
      computes a valid maximum flow and that you are able to visualize
      the result.
    </p>
    <p> Then, modify the edge capacities are no longer integers but
      positive values with decimal places. Verify again that the
      algorithm still computes a valid maximum flow and that the
      visualization remains reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, instead of assigning the edge capacities uniformly at
      random, use normally distributed non-negative capacities, with
      mean and standard deviation as adjustable parameters (crop all
      would-be negative values to be zero instead and remove those
      edges from the graph).  Verify once more that the algorithm
      still computes a valid maximum flow and that you can still
      visualize it.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      With the modified model from the basic stage, design and execute
      an experiment to detemine the effect of the following factors on
      the average maximum flow over all possible source-target pairs
      in the undirected, weighted graph:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>graph density (ratio of edges to potential edges)</li>
      <li>the mean of the edge-capacity distribution</li>
      <li>the standard deviation of the edge-capacity distribution</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For each factor, determine whether or not an increase in it also
      produces an increase in the average maximum flow over all
      pairs.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
     When electricity flows in a circuit, the same basic rules apply
     as in the network flow of the example code: no flow may be stored
     at any vertex, and sum of the incoming flow must match the sum of
     the outgoing flow in any vertex except the source and the
     target. These laws of physics are called the Kirchhoff laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the Kirchhoff laws and about other phenomena in which a
      substance of some kind flows through an infrastructure of some
      kind. What are the attributes of the model? What kind of rules
      do the models obey?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, think back on the propagation models discussed in Week 10
      when we spoke of epidemic spreading. In your own words, with
      your own illustrations, attempt to clarify the difference
      between flow and propagation as phenomena, indicating a handful
      of examples of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, describe at least a couple of real-world situations
      that are a mixture of flow and propagation, situations in which
      a proper model of what is happening would have to combine
      aspects of the two.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      When the flow is electricity, liquid, or gas, no explicit
      turn-taking, coordination, or synchronization is needed for the
      elements to pass. This is <em>not</em> the case in pedestrian or
      vehicular transit or when products progress on a production line
      in a factory or suitcases traverse the airport luggage logistics
      from the plane to the traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about (or read about) how the model would need to be
      adjusted to work with a phenomenon that <em>does</em> involve
      turn-taking of sorts. Write down and illustrate your ideas,
      citing your sources (if any).

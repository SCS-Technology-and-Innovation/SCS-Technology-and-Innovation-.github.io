	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  In addition to epidemiology where people are "down" with an
	  illness,
	  <strong>critical infrastructure</strong> such as supply
	  networks or transport networks can have some of their
	  elements "down" due to a failure or even a deliberate,
	  targeted attack. A powerful way study of the manner in which
	  systems break down is through <em>percolation models</em> in
	  which vertices and/or edges are iteratively and
	  systematically removed (possibly at random, possibly
	  preferentially to some attribute or calculated structural
	  property) and the effects of such repeated removal.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Study a <em>small-world</em> network model</li>
	    <li>Structurally <em>characterize</em> a graph and its elements</li>
	    <li>Alter the graph <em>layout</em></li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  We also revisit competencies developed in previous modules
	  to actively build upon them (such a visualizing a simulated
	  phenomenon over time and plotting a time series extracted
	  from the simulation).
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  This time, we start by
	  reading
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/604025/Hayastan-Shakarian-Georgia-Internet-Europe-Spade-Hacker">a
	    news article</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Having now learnt the scale of the impact of the actions of
	  an old lady, scour the internet for a similar example from
	  another context: a minor-seeming disruption (something
	  misplaced, something broken, something delayed, or something
	  deliberately attacked) that caused an unexpectedly
	  significant impact. In your response, please include a URL
	  to a text or a video documenting the example you found along
	  with a brief text (a paragraph or two at most) of your
	  thoughts on why the example you found is similar to the
	  warm-up story of the lady and the cable.
	</p>	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	</p>
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Percolation</li>
	  <li>Component</li>
	  <li>Centrality</li>
	  <li>Resilience</li>
	  <li>Robustness</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	  Should anything be missing or insufficient,
	  please <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://forms.office.com/r/D0pxMvbzsU">report</a> it.

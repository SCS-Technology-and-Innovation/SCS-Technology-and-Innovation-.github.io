	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  In recent years, an important application for multi-agent
	  models has been epidemiology: how to model contagion within
	  a population. This module takes us to simulate the
	  propagation of an infectious disease in a contact network of
	  individuals. We combine our knowledge of graphs in a
	  multi-agent context with our newly-gained knowledge of
	  modelling time.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:	 
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Apply a generation model for complex networks (specifically scale-free networks)</li>
	    <li>Model a propagation in a network (specifically a SIR model)</li>
	    <li>Choose pseudorandom subsets</li>
	    <li>Define a multi-stage simulation step</li>
	    <li>Record step-by-step data of interest in the form of <em>time series</em>
	      from a simulation (<strong>without</strong> having to store or
	      visualize the full details of each step)</li>
	    <li>Define a stopping condition (more sophisticated than a maximum step count)</li>
	    <li>Visualize time series</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  First, read
	  the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52473523">BBC news
	    story on how contagion rates are quantified</a>. Then, play for
	  with the
	  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Washington
	    Post Corona Simulator</a> for a few minutes to get a general gist of contagion
	  modeling. 
	</p>
	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Having now studied, briefly, epidemiology, discuss on what
	  aspects of society you find essential to incorporate in a
	  simulation of an outbreak of a contagious disease in order
	  for that simulation to be realistic enough to produce
	  actionable insights yet abstract enough to be fast and easy
	  to implement and study. List the aspects and, for each, give
	  your suggestion on what and how to model; for example, if
	  the aspect were "commute", one could simulate which
	  individuals will be enclosed in a shared vehicle, how often,
	  at what degree of proximity, and for how long at a time.
	</p>

	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Generation model</li>
	    <li>Preferential attachment</li>
	    <li>SIR model</li>
	    <li>Time series</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	  Should anything be missing or insufficient,
	  please <a target="_blank"
		    href="https://forms.office.com/r/D0pxMvbzsU">report</a> it.

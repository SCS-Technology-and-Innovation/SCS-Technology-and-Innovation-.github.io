	<h1>Recap</h1>
	<p>
	  This course is intended to be the first course in Graduate
	  Certificate in <em>Data Analysis for Complex Systems</em>
	  (DACS). Some students may take in in parallel with CCCS 620
	  or even CCCS 630, which is fine. To make the most of the
	  combination of those three courses that are all mandatory in
	  DACS, it is best to either follow the sequence in increasing
	  numerical order or by taking the courses simultaneously. We
	  chose not to force a pre-requisite sequence so that students
	  from diverse backgrounds can tailor the experience in a
	  flexible manner, but we do strongly recommend the proposed
	  order of this course being the first, CCCS 620 the second,
	  and CCCS 630 the third, should a student prefer to study one
	  course at a time. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  However, if you already took 620 or 630 before this one, you
	  should not get bored by any means. Just please be
	  understanding with your classmates who may not yet have had
	  exposure to all the tools and concepts that you encountered
	  in the other courses. It may overwhelm those new to the
	  field if we go into details of how things are connected when
	  they are yet to encounter many of the things being
	  discussed; hence it might be best to hold in-depth
	  conversations that mix and match this content with that of
	  the other courses as asynchronous discussions with the
	  instructor and those students who are up for the challenge
	  instead of taking the risk of confusingh a classmate during
	  the weekly live-class sessions.

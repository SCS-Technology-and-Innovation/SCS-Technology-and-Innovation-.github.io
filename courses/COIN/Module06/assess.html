	<h1>Scenario B<h1>
	<p>
	  You oversee the online discussion board of a nonprofit
	  organization for which you volunteer on weekends. It is
	  important to allow your target audience to interact, but you
	  worry about hate speech and spam. Assigning volunteer staff
	  to screen all posts and comments seems unfeasible, not only
	  because of the workload but also because of the constant
	  exposure to potential toxicity.

	<p>
	  You have been talking to your colleagues at the organization
	  about your plans at work for detecting pavement defects, and
	  they encourage you to explore options that would employ
	  computational intelligence to do the heavy lifting for you
	  in this task as well.

	alt="The forum log you requested are attached for each posting
	on the discussion board, indicating the author and the number
	of upvotes. I got the volunteers to label some of the posts
	either as spam or good and set the third column as none for

	else. Cheers, Robin.">
	<p>
	  Robin has been supporting your data-analysis efforts and has
	  helped clean up a dataset
	  (<a href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/casestudy/demo/logs.html">download
	  the log file</a>) from the forum posts. Your current
	  hypothesis is that people who post abnormally often and get
	  few up-votes might be undesirable users.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Authors are represented by their numerical user IDs since
	  you do not want anyone to think ill of an individual just
	  because your system might, at an early stage, imply that
	  they are a spammer or a troll.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  With your preferred computational tool (the Python example
	  from class is just fine), train a perceptron to label the
	  posts that were not manually labelled (those that
	  say <code>none</code> in the third column) into either spam
	  or good. Remember that your training set can only contain
	  data points that are manually labelled, and you might want
	  to set a part of those aside for testing purposes. Discuss
	  your code in writing and report the results of the
	  model. Include a <em>confusion matrix</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Select and compute at least three performance measures
	  (either based on the confusion matrix or on some other
	  aspect of the resulting model and/or of the training/testing
	  calculations).
	</p>    
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
	<h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Read the first chapter of the online textbook
	  <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">Neural
	  Networks and Deep Learning (Nielsen, 2019)</a>, and then
	  sketch a rudimentary illustrated glossary on the main
	  components and elements of a simple neural network.
	</p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Browse through the textbook
	  <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/37875698">An
	  Introduction of Neural Networks (Gurney, 1997)</a> and write
	  down any interesting advances, components, and elements that
	  more complex neural networks can contain and apply.

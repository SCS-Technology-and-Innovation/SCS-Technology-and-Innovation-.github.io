    <h1>Welcome to CCCS 610 Digital thinking for data analysis!</h1>
    <p>
      First of all, this is <em>not a programming course</em> in the
      traditional sense. Yes, we will work with code, specifically
      Python. No, you do not need to learn all of it from scratch and
      nobody expects you to be a self-sufficient developer by the end of
      the term. Our goal is to get everyone comfortable with how computers
      can be leveraged to represent and understand diverse situations. Our
      main interest is in learning to read code rather than to write it,
      and then to make gradually larger modifications to that code in
      order to achieve specific objectives we set out for ourselves.
    </p>
    <h2>Assumed previous knowledge</h2>
    <p>
      For students of DACS, this is intended to be the entry point into
      the certificate. Since we do not force students to take the courses
      in a particular order, some participants may have taken the other
      mandatory courses of DACS (CCCS 620 and CCCS 630) prior to this
      course or may be registered to one or both simultaneously. Not to
      worry, we strive to accomodate students who progress at different
      rhythms and orders. Make sure to speak out whenever you feel like we
      are covering too much ground too quickly so we can jointly discuss
      what concepts would make good self-study topics and into what depth
      one should go in each of them.
    </p>
    <h2>Assessments</h2>
    <p>
      There are no exams, there are no projects, there is no explicit
      group work. Collaborating on assessments is encouraged, although all
      sources (including discussions with fellow
      participants) <strong>must be properly cited in all submitted
	work</strong> and the participant must be the original author of any
      submitted text, data, illustrations, or program code that is not
      clearly cited to be from an external source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each week, there is an assessment that follows up on the topic of
      the live-class session. You have two options, each time. You can
      choose either the hands-on path or the conceptual journey (it is
      perfectly okay to fluctuate from one choice to another each week, if
      you prefer).
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you undertake a <strong>basic stage</strong> that should take
      you roughly four hours of total independent work (preparation,
      execution, documentation, submission). If you find yourself spending
      much more time on it and have difficulties finding out how to be
      more efficient, please reach out in class or during office hours for
      orientation. Satisfactory completion of each basic stage has you all
      set for passing the course with B- to stay in the program; the basic
      stage is graded on a scale from zero to five points.  For more
      details on the grading rubrics, please consult the course outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the basic stage, if you are particularly interested in the
      topic or aim for an A, you proceed to the <strong>in-depth
	stage</strong> that should take you up to three hours of additional
      independent study effort and land you up to two more points.

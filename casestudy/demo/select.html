    Coming here downloaded a dataset into your downloads
    folder. Please use that file to answer the quiz question. The file
    is called <code>casestudy.csv</code>, unless you already had a
    file of that name, in which case it is probably something
    like <code>casestudy(1).csv</code>. Erasing those files between
    quiz attempts is the easiest way to avoid using the wrong data by
    accident. Use the sidebar buttons to return to the quiz
    questions. This was question number 7.

    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Interacting with the in-class simulation, seek answers to the
      following questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Which, if any, of the statistics are affected, and how, by the way
	in which the worker is assigned to each client on their first
	visit?</li>
      <li>Which, if any, of the statistics are affected, and how, by whether
	or not the client will always want the same worker on subsequent
	visits?</li>
      <li>What would be a good rule of thumb, if any, for the lounge
      capacity as a function of the number of workers? How did you
      arrive at that hypothesis?</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
<p>
  Continue the exploration to address one more aspect of the
  operations. Barbershop has control over the lounge capacity, but not
  over the client patience (the churn threshold). Fix all other
  aspects of the simulation except those two and explore how one might
  be able to define the smallest lounge capacity at which churn (the
  proportion of clients lost to either excessive waiting or a full
  lounge) become neglible.

    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Watch an introductory video of what queuing theory is
      (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch0MRQcZSUE">this
      curated example</a> or another one of your choice) and then read
      a scientific article (please pick one that has a DOI) in which
      it is applied to a topic of your interest (for example
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.5812%2Fatr.7177">DOI
      10.5812/atr.7177</a> but you can
      use <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> or
      similar and search for "queuing theory" with additional search
      terms to define what interests you).
    </p>
    <p>
      Make a list of any unfamiliar concepts. Consult each concept on the
      list in the glossary and fill in the feedback form to suggest the
      inclusion of any that are absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summarize, in your own words (without resorting to an AI tool to
      summarize the text, that would not be acceptable for an assessment
      unless explicitly requested in the instructions), the utility that you
      perceive queuing theory to have in the application area discussed in
      the article.</p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Skim over the
article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-016-0995-z"> DOI
10.1007/s10115-016-0995-z</a> and summarize in your own words (again
without resorting to an AI tool to summarize the text) how data
analysis can be used to reduce churn.

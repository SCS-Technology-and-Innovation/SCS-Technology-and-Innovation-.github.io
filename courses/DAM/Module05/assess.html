    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Exploring data of at least three different stocks, formulate a working hypothesis on what kind of a visualization helps you to make good guesses on what may happen to the price in the near future (increase, descrease, stable)? What aspects of the visualization would you use to try to guess what the price will do next?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also read online for how investors try to foresee price changes; remember to cite your sources if you do.
    </p>
    <p>
Please include some screenshots of your data exploration in your response.

    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
<p>
    Instead of using stock-market data, pick some forex (foreign
    exchange) data sets instead (from the same Yahoo! Finance
    portal). Explore the visualization options and then, discuss any
    similarities and differences you identify between stock and forex
    data analysis.

  Remember to cite all sources and include some screenshots of your
  exploration in your response.

    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read online about stock correlation (for example
      at <a href="https://smartasset.com/investing/stock-correlation">smartasset.com</a>). Then,
      use the example tool from class to visualize some pairs of
      stocks (price of one against price of another) to try to observe
      any potential stock correlation. Discuss your findings in
      writing and how useful you perceive this type of analysis to be
      in making investment decisions.

    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Now, look into whether stock prices can be autocorrelated (that
      is, current price would correlate with price a fixed amount of
      time prior -- you can visualize this by plotting the price
      against a horizontally shifted version of itself). Maybe the
      price itself is not but some other feasture derived from the
      stock price is?</p>
    <p>
      Investigate online and poke around the class example tool. Discuss
      your readings and findings and thoughts in writing, potentially with
      screenshots.

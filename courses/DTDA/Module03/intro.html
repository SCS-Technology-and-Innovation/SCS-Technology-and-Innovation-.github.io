	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  We will continue leveraging the skills acquired in the first
	  two modules, revising many of the concepts. This time our
	  context is from telecommunications: how to place wireless
	  antennas (such as cellphone towers), assuming a simplified
	  mathematical model --- the town is a flat square and each
	  antenna has a circular range of the same radius. We will
	  delve deeper into the concept of <em>optimization</em>: how
	  do the decisions we make affect things such as cost and
	  quality?
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Do <em>rejection sampling</em> (Monte Carlo
	    method: accept pseudorandom data that meets a certain
	    condition) </li>
	    <li><em>Quantify</em> the consequences of our choices
	    (total coverage of possibly overlapping antennas)</li>
	    <li>avoid symbolic mathematics by applying simple
	    computation (think in terms of pixels instead of
	    pigeon-hole principles)</li>
	    <li><em>Normalize</em> values to the unit interval
	    (i.e., make many numbers be from zero to one while
	    maintaining their relative magnitudes)</li>
	    <li>Identify alternative ways to arrive at the same
	    result and pick the one that requires fewer
	    calculations</li>
	    <li>Work with two contradictory <em>objectives</em>
	    simultaneously (maximize coverage, minimize the antenna
	    count)</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Write down some ideas that you have regarding how to
	  determine the placement of each sensor node in a wireless
	  sensor network. Concentrate on things such as connectivity
	  between the components so as to allow communication and the
	  cost of the setup as a whole in terms of how many nodes you
	  would need to position to adequately monitor a fixed area.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Maximization</li>
	    <li>Coverage</li>
	    <li>Proportion</li>	  
	    <li>Normalization</li>
	    <li>Bi-objective</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>	
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.

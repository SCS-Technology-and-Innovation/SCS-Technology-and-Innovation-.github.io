    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Pick another book of your choice from Gutenberg and replicate
      the process of the example code to create a word cloud. Discuss
      any differences you encountered as well as new ideas you had to
      make the word cloud more representative of the contents of the
      book.
      </p>
    <p>
      Show your code, the resulting image, and remember to clearly
      cite any sources you may consult in the process.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Think of what kinds of graph representations you could build
      that might provide insight into the content of the book. Based
      on the example code discussed in class, create and visualize one
      such graph and discuss your findings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, show your code, the resulting image, and remember to
      clearly cite any sources you may consult in the process.
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Look into what computational topic detection means, how it is
      done, and what uses it may have. Summarize your findings.
      </p>
    <p>
      Remember to cite clearly all sources you consult during your
      research. Please share interesting sources you encounter with
      your fellow students while working on the assignment using the
      MS Team for students; you can acknowledge the contributions of
      your companions in a brief paragraph at the end of our
      response.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Similarly, look into computational sentiment analysis. Discuss
      how this relates to topic detection, if at all.
      </p>
    <p>
      Remember again to cite clearly all sources you consult during
      your research. Please share interesting sources you encounter
      with your fellow students while working on the assignment using
      the MS Team for students; you can acknowledge the contributions
      of your companions in a brief paragraph at the end of our
      response.

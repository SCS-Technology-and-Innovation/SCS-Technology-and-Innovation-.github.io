  	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  In the previous module, our focus was in describing the
	  state of things and the rules that govern how the universe
	  operates. The next level is to describe not only the initial
	  state, but also a desired target state to which we want the
	  world to move. Then, ensuring that all rules are respected
	  at all times, identify possible sequences of actions one can
	  take to lead the state of the world from the initial one to
	  the target state. This process is called planning and is at
	  the focus of the present module.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Get acquianted with classical planning problems</li>
	    <li>Measure plan performance in terms of its length</li>
	    <li>Model phenomena in terms of state diagrams </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  The <em>blocks world</em> is a classical toy problem
	  in <em>planning</em> which is an important (non-ML) type of
	  AI. The below video is a bit long and gives much more detail
	  than is necessary for our present purposes, but a
	  double-speed no-sound glance at it gives you some context to
	  what formal planning refers to:

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  After watching the video (or at least parts of it), again
	  off the top of your head without consulting sources,
	  identify at least one problem of each of the following
	  fields that could possibly be solved (in part or wholly)
	  with a well-designed planning algorithm: (a) healthcare, (b)
	  supply networks (e.g., storage or transportation of goods)
	  (b) manufacture of goods.
	</p>
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:	
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>State</li>
	  <li>Action</li>
	  <li>Goal</li>
	  <li>(Deterministic) transition</li>	  
	  <li>(Optimal) plan</li>
	  <li>Planner</li>            
	</ul>

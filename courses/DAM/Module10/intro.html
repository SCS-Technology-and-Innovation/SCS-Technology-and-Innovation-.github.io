	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  When a computational system appears to be "intelligent", it
	  is usually gathering and analyzing data behind the
	  scenes. This module is focused on that: there is
	  a <em>training</em> phase in which the user provides both
	  data and a label for the data, after which there is
	  a <em>testing</em> phase in which we provide the data and
	  then have the system suggest a label to it. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The observed data in this case will be keystrokes the user
	  types. What is stored is which key is pressed and at what
	  time. This raw data is then processed by
	  extracting <em>features</em> from it (the time between two
	  consecutive keypresses and what were the two keys in
	  question). The training records these intervals for the key
	  pairs that are observed and stores them under the provided
	  label (the method the user employs to type). Then, in the
	  resting stage, the intervals are recorded again. A suggested
	  label results from comparing the testing sample (with simple
	  statistics) to the formerly provided training samples and
	  picking the most similar one.

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Objectives</h2>
	<p>
	  In this module, you will have an opportunity to...
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>... train a supervised model</li>
	    <li>... test a trained model</li>
	    <li>... generate and label training data</li>
	    <li>... explore model sensivity to evolving patterns in input data</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  The pre-class activity is <strong>cursorial</strong> reading
	  (not in-depth by any means, skip anything you do not manage to
	  find interesting or comprehensible) of

	<h1>Project presentations</h1>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Introduction</h2>
	<p>
	  In this module, the participants present their project, from
	  the problem statement to the results obtained over the
	  course of the term. 
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	</p>	
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Present your work in a scientific forum</li>
	  <li>Apply a rubric to assess your own work</li>
	  <li>Apply a rubric to assess the work of your peers</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Readings</h2>
	<p>
	  There are no readings associated to this session.
	</p>
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Tools</h2>
	<p>
	  If you do not wish to present live on Zoom, you can
	  pre-record your presentation and upload it to a cloud
	  service of your choice (such as YouTube). You can choose the
	  "Unlisted" option to keep your recording accessible to only
	  those who know the direct URL. It is highly recommended to
	  prepare a video even if you intend to present live, as a way
	  to prevent unforeseen circumstances from interfering with
	  your presentation or impeding it altogether.
	</p>
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Assessment: Contribution</h2>
	<p>
	  <strong>Submission deadline</strong>: by the start of the
	  exam period.
	</p>	
	<h3>Basic stage (up to 15 pts)</h3>
	<p>
	  <strong>Submitted material</strong>: a single PDF file
	  containing the URLs of the written report (mandatory), the
	  code repository (mandatory), the presentation video
	  (optional), and the self/peer assessments (c.f. the rubric
	  below).
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>Rubric</strong>: at most one point per each of the
	  ten criteria below, on a scale of 0 (insufficient) versus 1
	  (adequate). The criteria are grouped into three categories,
	  as per the three deliverables (report, code, presentation):
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Written report: style and structure</li>
	  <li>Written report: connections to the state of the art</li>
	  <li>Written report: pertinence of methodology</li>
	  <li>Written report: data visualization</li>
	  <li>Computational contribution: richness of data (processed, emulated or both)</li>
	  <li>Computational contribution: extent of implemented functionality</li>
	  <li>Computational contribution: clarity of comments  
	  <li>Oral presentation: clarity</li>
	  <li>Oral presentation: pace</li>
	  <li>Oral presentation: structure</li>
	</ol>	      
	<p>
	  Up to two points for <strong>self assessment</strong> on a
	  scale of 0 (none provided), 1 (shallow), 2 (thorough and
	  thoughtful observations).
	</p>
	<p>Up to three points for <strong>peer assessment</strong> on
	  a scale of 0 (none provided), 1 (few and shallow), 2 (the
	  work of at least two peers assessed with actionable
	  constructive feedback), and 3 (the work of three of more peers assessed
	  with actionable constructive feedback).
	</p>
 	<h3>In-depth stage (up to 5 pts)</h3>
	<p>
	  Reflect back on how you chose the topic, crafted the
	  methodology, and carried out the steps, then leave your
	  earlier self (as if you could go back in time to) notes on
	  what to do differently: what would you write and why?
	</p>
	<p>
	  Each clearly and coherently expressed advice to self gives
	  one point, with a maximum of five points in total.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Add these reflections at the end of the PDF submitted in
	  myCourses under a clear section header identifying them as
	  the in-depth stage of the assessment.

    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>

    <p>
      Interacting with the scheduling model and the solution method
      studied in class, examine systematically how the following
      factors appear to affect the percentage of appointments that are
      successfully scheduled:
    </p>
    <ul class="action-items">
      <li>Number of patients</li>
      <li>Average number of appointments per patient</li>
      <li>Probability of doctor availability</li>
      <li>Probability of equipment availabiility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Explain first the <em>methodology</em> you have designed for
      your systematic examination, then report your results, and
      conclude with an interpretation of the results. Remember to
      clearly cite any sources you may consult while designing and
      reporting.
      </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      What <em>other</em> factors can you identify there that also
      appear to affect the percentage of appointments scheduled?
      Draft some guidelines on how one could attempt to map out such
      dependencies between adjustable parameters and the
      characteristics of the resulting solution.
      </p>
    <p>
      Apply your guidelines to this scenario and report your findings.
      Include both the guidelines and the findings in clear writing in
      your response.
</p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Based on the exploration of the tool in class, document how one
      could deduce actionable insights on the following aspects using
      a model like the one studied in class?
    </p>
    <ul class="action-items">
      <li>Which equipment is lacking and where?</li>
      <li>Which room types are too abundant or scarce?</li>
      <li>Which doctors are not available often enough to provide
	enough patient care?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Document your suggestions in writing and remember to clearly cite
      any sources you might consult.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Skim over the
      article <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.05.004">DOI
      10.1016/j.ejor.2021.05.004</a> to make your best guess (try not
      to worry about unfamiliar terms this time, there may be too
      many) on
      <ul class="action-items">
      <li>what in are the "resource constraints" in our example model
	we studied in class, and,</li>
      <li>what kind of "temporal constraints" could we incorporate to
      replace or enhance the concept of <em>priority</em> in our
      model?</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

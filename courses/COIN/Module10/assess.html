	<p>
	  Robin, your trusted colleague in IT, has combined the video recordings
	  of the six drones into a single massive patchwork TIFF image (called
	  an orthomosaic) of the entire downtown area. Each pixel can be roughly
	  mapped into a latitude-longitude pair.
	</p>
	
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Formulate a plan that indicates what to do with the
	  orthomosaic image and how to advance your plan of detecting
	  and repairing potholes and other pavement defects. You can
	  include some open-licence photos from the internet as
	  examples illustrating the proposed steps and the expected
	  outcomes.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  (This task is recommended for those who have already taken
	  CCCS 610.) Carry out some image processing in Python to
	  highlight a few elements of interest in an orthomosaic (or
	  aerial) image of your choice. There are not many options
	  online with free usage rights, but you could, for example,
	  highlight the walls of the structure in
	  <A href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Yacimiento_arqueol%C3%B3gico_de_Lancia_02_-_by_smart-drone.es.jpg">this
	  Wikimedia image of the Lancia ruins</a>.

    </p>    
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Browse
	  through <a href="https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1012344100"><em>Computer
	  Vision: Principles, Algorithms, Applications, Learning</em>
	  (a comprehensive computer-vision textbook by E. R. Davies
	  and E. Roy, 2018)</a>, and draw a flow chart of what you
	  understand a typical process of computational intelligence
	  to be when the input data consists of one or more images,
	  and the output is some sort of recommendation regarding the
	  content of the input data.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Investigate how multiple images can be combined into a large
	  orthomosaic image
	  (<a href="https://geonadir.com/what-is-an-orthomosaic/">for
	  example, this one on the Geonadir website</a>). Again, draw
	  a flow chart to illustrate the steps of the process. At each
	  step, attach a note indicating how computationally
	  challenging it appears to be (both how hard it is to design
	  an algorithm for that step and how slow the algorithm would
	  be in actually completing the step).

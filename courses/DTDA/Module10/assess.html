    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Modify the example code into one in which reinfections are
      possible. Think of (or look up) possible ways to model and
      implement partial or temporary immunity, either by vaccination
      or as natural immunity from having recently recovered. What
      would the parameters be for those immunity models?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pick one immunity model, no matter how unrealistic, to implement
      and experiment with. Document clearly how you measure the impact
      of varying the parameter(s) of the immunity model.
    </p>

      readings and videos with your classmates.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to immunity, one could also reduce the connections
      between the vertices of the graph or seek ways to lower the
      probability of contagion upon contact (such as distancing,
      wearing masks, handwashing).
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of a way (or look one up) to try to compare, in some
      rudimentary fashion, which of the three options is able to
      dampen the epidemic peak the most (and/or push it further ahead
      in time to allow the medical system to prepare): vaccination,
      reduction of contacts, or lowering the probability of contagion?

    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read about mathematical modelling in medical epidemiology and
      then look into the same aspect but for computer viruses. What
      differences can you identify, if any?
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to clearly cite all sources and to share interesting
      readings and videos with your classmates.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Look also into how other propagating phenomena such as
      wildfires, floods, or cascading failures in electric networks or
      airports are modelled and studied. Pay special attention to
      methods and concepts related to containment of the propagation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a summary, optionally with (hand or computer drawn)
      original visualizations of at least three such phenomena,
      identifying potential containment methods for each. Cite your
      sources, but please refrain from reusing existing imagery as
      such. Instead, try to express your own understanding of the
      model (the elements, the means of propagation, and the
      containment mechanisms) in your own words and in a diagram of
      your choice and creation.

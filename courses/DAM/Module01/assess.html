    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
Experiment with the simulation to determine a general rule for
choosing the best place to stand if one seeks to minimize the average
distance from the waiting spot to the arriving elevator.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, formulate a plan in writing on how to conduct the experiment in terms of what combinations to try and what data to record.</li>
      <li>Then, report the data you collected in a clear and concise manner.</li>
      <li>Finally, analyze the data and document your conclusions.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Experiment with the simulation to determine a general rule for
      choosing the best place to stand if one seeks to minimize the
      maximum distance from the waiting spot to the arriving elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determine clearly the difference between the current problem statement
      and the one of the basic stage. Then, repeat the same three steps.

    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read the first recommended reading, linked on top of the
      simulator. Reflect, in writing, upon the relationship of what
      the blog post describes and your understanding of what the
      simulation does.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read the second recommended reading. Now, establish the
      relationship of what is being said in the forum discussion and
      the information conveyed in the blog post. Why do you think that
      the comments are emphasizing the difference between
      "<em>the</em> median" and "<em>any</em> median"?

      List all terms or annotations that are unafamiliar to
      you. Consult the glossary
      and <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/VZpfFrZhRu">submit
      requests of clarification or inclusion</a> for any term that you
      cannot locate or understand.

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  We have thus far encountered propagation of sorts: the
	  synchronization of the oscillators in Module 9, the spread
	  of an infection in an epidemic model in Module 10, and in
	  some sense also the percolation in Module 11. This time, we
	  the propagation will be an actual <em>displacement</em> of a
	  substance (whether concrete or abstract) through a network
	  model. There is a single <strong>source</strong> from which
	  said substance originates (that is, enters our system) and a
	  single <strong>sink</strong> into which the substance is
	  headed (an exit point). The substance must <em>flow</em>
	  along the edges of the graph. It is not permitted to
	  accumulate in the intermediate vertices and each edge has a
	  specific (possibly distinct) capacity that limits the number
	  of units of the substance that can traverse that particular
	  edge. Substance can neither vanish at any vertex other than
	  the sink nor can appear at any vertex other than the source,
	  so there are laws of physics to respect at all
	  times. Luckily there is an efficient algorithm for this
	  problem that we can employ to arrive at an optimal solution
	  that maximizes the total flow from the sink to the source,
	  respecting the restrictions set on how the flow may proceed.

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Create uniform random graphs</li>
	    <li>Orient an undirected graph into a directed graph</li>
	    <li>Assign and visualize edge weights</li>
	    <li>Access data stored in sets and dictionaries</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Again, we also build upon previously gained competencies by
	  altering graph layouts and filtering information.
	</p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  In an earlier module, we thought about how to realistically
	  simulate an epidemilogical study. Now we do the same for
	  vehicular traffic: what are the aspects that should be
	  included, why, and how? Provide a list with a brief
	  explanation of each aspect and a rationale for its relevance
	  and an idea on how to possibly incorporate it into a
	  simulation. A handful of aspects (three or more) is enough
	  to warrant you the point, provided you write in a style
	  corresponding to the grad student that you are.
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	</p>
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Directed graph</li>
	  <li>Edge capacity</li>
	  <li>Flow</li>
	  <li>Bottleneck</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
	     Should anything be missing or insufficient,
	     please <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://forms.office.com/r/D0pxMvbzsU">report</a>
	     it.

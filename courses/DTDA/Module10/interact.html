    <h1>Flattening the curve</h1>
    <h2>Modeling the propagation of a contagion</h2>
    <p>
      In the Python notebook for this module, we build a model of a
      contact network between individuals, introduce a contagion, and
      simulate its propagation. To download the notebook for your own
      computer, use the "view raw" option (bottom right), save the
      file, and then use your notebook viewer to open the saved
      file. To interact with it online, use the "Open in Colab" button
      (top left).

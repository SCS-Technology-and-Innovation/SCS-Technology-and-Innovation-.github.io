	<h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Review the documentation of the <em>graph-coloring
	    algorithms</em> included in the <a target="_blank"
					       href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/coloring.html">networkx
      library</a> &mdash; our strategy is essentially the same as
	  <code>strategy_largest_first</code>.
    </p>
	<p>
	  Pick one of the <em>other</em> methods and write additional code
	  to apply it on our graph. Does the number of colors it uses seem
	  to differ from our approach? 
	</p>
	<h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Systematically compare at least two other methods with our
	  original strategy, using at least ten different replicas of the
	  graph-generation process. Record the minimum, average, and
	  maximum number of colors used by each method over the set of
	  replicas and discuss the results in writing.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
	<h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Read (for
	  example <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2022.06.392">DOI
	    10.1016/j.matpr.2022.06.392</a>) or watch (for
	  example <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4RAYQjKb5Y">a
	    video tutorial</a>) information on other applications of graph
	  coloring (than map coloring and frequency assignment).
	</p>
    <p>
      Write down your personal top five of unfamiliar terms that you
      encounter along with your present best guess of what those terms
      might mean. Then, consult them in the glossary and fill in the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://forms.office.com/r/D0pxMvbzsU">glossary
	feedback form</a> if any are missing.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Pick three applications of the graph coloring problem (from what
	  you studied in the basic stage of the assessment and/or those
	  discussed in class). For each one, think about how important it
	  would be to truly minimize the total number of colors instead of
	  just trying to keep the amount low?
    </p>
	<p>
      Also, think about whether you find it truly critical that no
      neighbors ever share a color or would it simply be mildly
      inconvenient for each application.
	</p>
	<p>
      Discuss your thought process and conclusions in
      writing. Remember to clearly cite all sources.

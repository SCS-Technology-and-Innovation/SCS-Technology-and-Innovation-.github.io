  	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  As promised, we now began to explore the process behind
	  financial decisions. In the previous module, we looked back
	  at historical data to gain knowledge of the past behavior of
	  a time series as well as seek relationships between two data
	  sets. Now, using the same historical data, we will begin to
	  court the concept of <em>prediction</em>: what if we look at
	  the start of a historical time series up an intermediate
	  point of time and pretend we do not know the rest of it
	  &mdash; as if we had travelled back in time and also had
	  amnesia. Such thought exercise puts us at a position where we
	  can try to make a prediction of what might happen next,
	  given our observations of what has happened until now, then
	  make a decision to either take action or wait, and (this is
	  the cool part) finally study the outcome of our decision by
	  looking at the "future data" that comes after the
	  intermediate point of time to which we chose to "travel
	  back".

	  In the illustration above, the left-hand side is the earlier
	  data that we are allowed to analyze. The right-hand side is
	  the data we pretend not to have. We make predictions and/or
	  take action based on our analysis at the cut-off point. Then
	  we let "time advance" by looking at that previously ignored
	  later data to assess what would have happened: was our
	  prediction precise, did we choose our actions (or lack
	  thereof) appropriately in terms of the resulting outcome?

	<p>
	  In this module, you will have an opportunity to...
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>... identify trends and patterns in time series</li>
	    <li>... emulate historical data as a basis for decision making</li>
	    <li>... observe the impacts of decision in light of future data</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

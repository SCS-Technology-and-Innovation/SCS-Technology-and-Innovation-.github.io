	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  Game theory works well with a handful of players or
	  collaborators making choices from within a predefined set or
	  range of options. If we were to venture into a planning
	  problem but with multiple decision makers and changing
	  conditions of which the entities would have partial or
	  imprecise knowledge, it would quickly get a bit too complex
	  to sort out whether there is an equilibrium of
	  sorts. Sorting out a consensus in more complex and dynamic
	  settings calls for another approach that has already been
	  hinted at in CCCS 610, 620 and 630: multi-agent
	  systems. Think of an "agent" as a software and/or hardware
	  entity that has some internal state (memory), some way of
	  observing the state of the world (sensors, inputs, or the
	  like) and some way of effecting change the state of the
	  world and/or its own internal state. Examples include the
	  fireflies or the contagious individuals of CCCS 610 and the
	  barbers of CCCC 620 &mdash; if we traded stocks for real
	  (and not in a isolated emulation like in CCCS 620), that
	  would also count as a multi-agent system that would be a
	  mixture of individuals, organizations, and bots.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The way in which the agents adjust their individual
	  responses (think for example of a large space with multiple
	  air conditioners, each with its own thermostat) to their
	  observations of the current state of things (too hot) in
	  order to reach a desired state of things (a goal
	  temperature) is the object of study of yet another field of
	  math: control theory. This module brings these new concepts
	  to the table for you to gain an awareness of how they may
	  contribute to computationally intelligent(-seeming) systems
	  and identify when they might be employed.
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Identify multi-agent phenomena</li>
	    <li>Examine leader-follower coordination</li>
	    <li>Formulate rules for operating in formation</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  The easiest thing to think of when first wrapping one's head
	  around what multi-agent coordination means are cute (or
	  creepy) robots going about something complex in
	  formation. Let's start with that as a pre-class activity:

		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
		encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;
		web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Faithful to the style established in former warm-up
	  assessments, first you watch the video and then you think of
	  (original) answers to the following without consulting
	  sources or recurring to tools of any kind: if you had in
	  your disposition a team that can design, assemble, and
	  program a swarm of robots, what pressing real-world problem
	  would you be keen to address if your robots could (a) crawl,
	  dig, and climb; (b) fly and hover; (c) swim and dive?
	</p>
        <h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	<ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Agent</li>
	  <li>Multi-agent</li>
	  <li>Coordination</li>
	  <li>Leader-follower</li>
	  <li>Control theory</li>            
	</ul>
	</p>

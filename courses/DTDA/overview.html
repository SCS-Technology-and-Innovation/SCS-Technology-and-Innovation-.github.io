      Welcome! First of all, this is <em>not a programming course</em>
      in the traditional sense. Yes, we will work with code,
      specifically Python. No, you do not need to learn all of it from
      scratch and nobody expects you to be a self-sufficient developer
      by the end of the term. Our goal is to get everyone comfortable
      with how computers can be leveraged to represent and understand
      diverse situations. Our main interest is in learning to read
      code rather than to write it, and then to make gradually larger
      modifications to that code in order to achieve specific
      objectives we set out for ourselves.
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Assumed previous knowledge</h2>
    <p>
      For students of DACS, this is intended to be the entry point into
      the certificate. Since we do not force students to take the courses
      in a particular order, some participants may have taken the other
      mandatory courses of DACS (CCCS 620 and CCCS 630) prior to this
      course or may be registered to one or both simultaneously. Not to
      worry, we strive to accomodate students who progress at different
      rhythms and orders. Make sure to speak out whenever you feel like we
      are covering too much ground too quickly so we can jointly discuss
      what concepts would make good self-study topics and into what depth
      one should go in each of them.
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Assessments</h2>
    <p>
      There are no exams, there are no projects, there is no explicit
      group work. Collaborating on assessments is encouraged, although all
      sources (including discussions with fellow
      participants) <strong>must be properly cited in all submitted
	work</strong> and the participant must be the original author of any
      submitted text, data, illustrations, or code that is not
      clearly cited to be from an external source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each week, there is an assessment that follows up on the topic of
      the live-class session. You have two options, each time. You can
      choose either the hands-on path or the conceptual journey (it is
      perfectly okay to fluctuate from one choice to another each week, if
      you prefer).
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you undertake a <strong>basic stage</strong> that should take
      you roughly four hours of total independent work (preparation,
      execution, documentation, submission). If you find yourself spending
      much more time on it and have difficulties finding out how to be
      more efficient, please reach out in class or during office hours for
      orientation. Satisfactory completion of each basic stage has you all
      set for passing the course with B- to stay in the program; the basic
      stage is graded on a scale from zero to five points.  For more
      details on the grading rubrics, please consult the course outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the basic stage, if you are particularly interested in the
      topic or aim for an A, you proceed to the <strong>in-depth
      stage</strong> that should take you up to three hours of
      additional independent study effort and land you up to two more
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please take free-form notes of all your study activities during
      the course and submit those at the end of the course as your
      learning journal to document your participation. Each session
      for which you have documented learning activities gives you one
      point. The total weight of this activity is nine points, but any
      exceeding points (since there are 13 sessions in total) will
      count as bonus points to recover any missing or incomplete
      weekly activities so you can still get a perfect grade of 100
      even if you had a rough time at some point along the way. You
      can create a
      personal <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/tls/students/learning-resources/use-technology/learning-mural">mural</a>
      for your learning journal, if you'd like, and you can also
      contribute to
      a <a href="https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/studentworkspace7102/1688572504817?sender=ud6bb475199fc1447b7fb1107&key=c6c32691-6dc6-4ffa-a4da-da111aa1bc7b">collective
      mural for this course</a>.

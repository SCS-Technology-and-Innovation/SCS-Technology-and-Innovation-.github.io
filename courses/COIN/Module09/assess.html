	<h1>Scenario C</h1>

	<p>
	  A major commute hub has offered for your municipality to use
	  the large info screens in their waiting areas to display
	  public awareness announcements. This is great since you, as
	  a dedicated public servant striving for the common good,
	  have a lot to share with the residents of your town
	  regarding the impact their everyday choices have on the
	  environment, climate, public health (both mental and
	  physical), privacy, and security. Yet after a month, no
	  heads seem to be turning towards the screens displaying your
	  thoughtful messages.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are no funds available for hiring a copywriter or a
	  graphic designer to make the text catchier or the
	  slideshow more appealing. Your attempts to add
	  background music resulted in questions about copyright
	  and royalty payments. You are hoping that artificial
	  intelligence can give your modest infomercials a
	  much-needed makeover.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Explore and apply existing free online tools to generate
	  text, a still background image, and music for a brief,
	  catchy video emphasizing the importance of making small
	  everyday choices to reduce one’s carbon footprint.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
	<p>
	  Turn the background image into a dynamic, animated visual
	  with an AI tool (free online tools are fine; just beware of
	  malware and avoid giving out any personal information).
	</p>    
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
	<h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Read about how AI models that generate images are
	  trained. Where does the training data come from?  Did the
	  artists explicitly and knowingly consent to the use of their
	  work as training data?  What do you expect will happen
	  (short- and long-term) when new AI models are trained with
	  data that contain increasing quantities of AI-generated
	  images?
	</p>
	<h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
	<p>
	  Once you have completed this task, repeat it but this time for AI-composed music.

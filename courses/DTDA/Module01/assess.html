    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Complete
      the <a href="https://mathigon.org/course/fractals/introduction">asynchronous
      lesson on fractals at mathigon.org</a> and summarize in your own
      words what you learned from the interactive elements, in
      addition to what you learned during class.
      </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Create a variant of the Python code using turtle to create a
      structure that looks like a plant of some kind (another type of
      snowflake, a tree, a leaf); show your code and at least one
      resulting example image. You can find inspiration
      in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBuPWdSbyf8">videos</a>
      and images online, but please do not settle with reproducing
      something that already exist. Instead, experiment to create your
      own.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Read more about fractals at the information source of your
      choice (for example
      on <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/math-concepts/fractals.htm">howstuffworks.com</a>)
      and summarize what you learned from the explanation in your own
      words, in addition to what you learned during class. Remember to
      cite your sources in a clear manner.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Skim through the journal article by Tannier and Pumain
      with <a href="https://doi.org/10.4000/cybergeo.3275">DOI
      10.4000/cybergeo.3275</a> and reflect in writing, potentially
      with drawings or annotated images (of maps, aerieal photos, or
      satellite imagery) upon how these types of patterns are visible
      in Montreal (or some other region of your choice that you are
      familiar with and find inspiring), from your point of view.

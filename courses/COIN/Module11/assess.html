	thanks for the amazing support tool Robin and you have given
	us to reduce the manual workload of figuring out which of the
	forum users are spam-bots or trolls. We were thinking of
	permanently banning from our site any users that are tagged as
	spam by the system just so we never have to deal with them
	again. What are your thoughts?">
	<p>
	  Considering that usernames are used not only for the
	  discussion forum but also for signing up to support groups,
	  you have some concerns. What if someone gets banned by
	  mistake and then loses access to a service that is essential
	  to their well-being? You don’t want to make people think
	  that your system is bad, but it would also be unreasonable
	  to expect it to be infallible.

    <h3>Basic stage</h3>
	<p>
	  Find and read reports about unethical use of AI. Then,
	  compile a brief list of reports that clearly express ethical
	  concerns. The sources you’ve found should dissuade
	  colleagues from using a model that imposes permanent bans on
	  users. You also want to avoid making them think AI is
	  useless or too risky. Remember to clearly cite all your
	  sources.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage</h3>
	<p>
	  Read
	  <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/ai-principles/">this
	  page about the Asilomar AI principles</a> and prepare a
	  three-column table of the 23 points (first column) to
	  indicate how much you feel you understand (second column)
	  and agree with (third column) each one.  Use a scale of your
	  choice to indicate your level of agreement.

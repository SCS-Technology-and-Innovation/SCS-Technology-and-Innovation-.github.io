    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Prepare to document each step you take either with screenshots
      or by recording your screen throughout the experiment. There is
      no need to record any audio unless you want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pick a paragraph of text. Select the training stage ("Providing
      sample data") and type that text at least once for each typing
      method (both hands, only right, only left, single finger).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, switch to the testing stage ("Comparing to sample data")
      and type the text again at least once with just one of the
      methods. Click on "Analyze" and see if the result matches the
      typing method you chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Document the result, click on "Reset analysis" and repeat at
      least once for each of the other typing methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, experiment with how much you have to consciously alter
      your typing to make it impossible for the detection method to
      correctly determine the way in which you typed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you video-recorded the screen, please upload the video to a
      cloud service of your choice and provide the URL in your
      submission together with a written discussion of the process and
      your findings. If you took screenshots, please include a
      representative amount of them in your report.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Right-click to select "View source" on your browser to look at
      the HTML code of the page that runs the example system. Then,
      click click on the JavaScript link (file
      extension <code>.js</code>) to look at the actual program
      code. Find the code segment that records the keystrokes and
      determine how the following to tasks are accomplished:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What data is collected and stored when sample data is being
      collected (during training)?</li>
      <li>How is the comparison to the stored samples done during the
      comparison stage to find out which method is being used while
      typing?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Document with code fragments and discussion in your own words what
      appears to be happening. You can provide fragments of the code to an
      AI model like ChatGPT or similar if you like to see what the AI
      thinks the code is doing and why.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose that instead of varying how a single person types,
      different individuals provide training data for the system. (You
      could test this by typing with both hands yourself to train for
      the method "right hand only" and have a family member or a
      friend type normally to train for the methor "left hand only",
      if you like, and then testing whether the system is able to tell
      which of you is typing in the comparison stage by having one of
      you type, then analyze, and seeing whether the output is "right
      hand only" or "left hand only".)
    </p>
    <p>
      The example system uses the time (in milliseconds) between pairs
      of consecutive keystrokes. Discuss under what circumstances
      (that is, what kind of a text does the person need to type and
      in what conditions) this way of identifying the individual who
      is typing could work. What are the limitations?
    </p>
    <p>
      What benefits do you foresee in using this type of user authentication
      by itself? Are their additional benefits if it were combined with
      other authentication methods like passwords, facial recognition, voice
      recognition, etc.?
    </p>
	<h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Search for scientific studies that identify people based on
      (rhytmic or other) behavioral phenomena, such as walking pace,
      pressure patterns while walking, seated, lying down, and others
      you can think of. Discuss potential applications you encounter
      for these methods in scientific literature or in commercial
      products, as well as original ideas that you yourself have on
      what could be done based on such recognition of individuals.

    <h2 class="topic-heading">Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Modify the Python code used in class to also generate
      pseudorandomly a population for the city. Instead of a uniform
      distribution, use a geometric distribution
      (<a target="_blank" href="https://web.ccsu.edu/faculty/kyem/GEOG473/5thWeek/Food%20production%20and%20GM%20foods.htm">read
      this</a> for a reason why to do that and
      <a target="_blank" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.geometric.html">check
       here</a> how to achieve it).
    </p>
    <p>
      Modify the drawing of the visualization to draw each city in a size
      that depends on its population (ideally on a logarithmic scale).
    </p>
    <p>
      Show your code and the resulting visualization.
      </p>
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
<p>
  Bigger cities tend to have more incoming roads. If we modify the
  edge cost to contemplate not only the distance between the cities
  but also the population of the two towns, we could make both MST and
  TSP favor roads that connect big cities.
</p>
<p>
  One option would be to divide the euclidean distance by the sum (or
  the product) of the two populations, although there are numerous other
logical ways to go about this idea as well.
</p>
<p>
  Either pick one of the above ideas or create your own and test it out
in the example code from class, combined with your code for the basic
  stage of this assessment.
</p>
<p>
  Show your code and the resulting visualization. Remember to cite clearly all sources you consult during your research.
  </p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-heading">Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
<p>
  Read about, watch videos, or just think about how does the way in
  which roads are build differs for the different layers in the
  transport hierarchy: local roads within a suburb, urban roads within
  a city, highways between cities. Discuss in writing your thoughts
  each process and the different factors that you find relevant for
  each process, with particular emphasis on differences you
  identify. Think about differences between the transport of people
  and the transport of goods (cargo) and whether they are significant
  for the different levels of the road hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
  Remember to cite clearly all sources you consult during your research.
  
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
<p>
  Read about, watch videos, or just think about different methods of
  transport for people and/or cargo: ground transport by cars,
  railways, airplanes and airports, boats and ports. What additional
  factors do you find relevant for other modes of transport that you
  did not discuss in the basic stage for ground transportation?
</p>
<p>
  Remember again to cite clearly all sources you consult during your
  research.

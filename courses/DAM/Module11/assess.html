    <h2>Hands-on option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Browse through the JavaScript code to see how the data
      attributes are processed into a distance measure. Pay particular
      attention to normalizing and the way the attributes are combined
      into a single measurement of distance.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the hands-on option</h3>
    <p>
      Save both the HTML and the JS file on your computer so you can
      edit the code. Within the distance calculations, add weights to
      the attributes so that the color has a high impact than than the
      position and that the size has a very small impact on
      similarity.
    <p>
    </p>
    With before and after screenshots or videos, document the effect
    of your modifications in the behavior of the clustering.
    </p>
    <h2>Conceptual option</h2>
    <h3>Basic stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      Investigate methods to express qualitative similarity of
      non-numerical data (text, images, sound, opinions, etc.) in
      numerical terms. You can take a look
      at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-30958-8">an
      example textbook</a> or search for sources on your own.
    <p>
    </p>
      Report your findings in writing, with concrete examples of different
      kinds of non-numerical attributes and approaches to define numerical
    similarity measures for them. Remember to clearly cite all sources.
    </p>
    <h3>In-depth stage for the conceptual option</h3>
    <p>
      The value chosen for <em>k</em> affects the outcome
      of <em>k</em>-means clustering quite significantly. Investigate
      guidelines on how to choose it as well as automated methods for
      setting the value of <em>k</em>. Do not worry about the mathematical and
      computational details, but try to uncover the essence of the
      logic behind the choice.
    <p>
    </p>
    Describe your findings in writing with your own words, citing all of
    your sources.

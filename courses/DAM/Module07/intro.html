  	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>
	  The stock market is not the only finance market one should
	  seek to understand. Real estate is another one that for many
	  is closer to their daily lives. We all need a place to live,
	  and whether to rent or buy is a decision that keeps popping
	  up when one progresses through stages of life. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  In Module 5 we explored the correlation of two time series
	  (two different stock prices or the autocorrelation of a time
	  series to a shifted version of itself) and how we will dig
	  deeped into this concept and take it one step further by
	  examining a <em>linear regression</em> model that emerges
	  (largely as a happy side product) from the calculations we
	  do to detemine the correlation.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We also need to learn to be creative with our data
	  sources. Assume we want to establish a relationship between
	  what a residential property costs (if one should buy the
	  property) versus what the monthly rent of that same property
	  would be. Although some cross-list their real estate as "buy
	  or rent", most properties are listed as either-or. Unless we
	  are able to create a pair dataset of "sales price" versus
	  "rent price", we cannot check for a correlation and &mdash;
	  alas &mdash; cannot fit the regression model either. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  One way to go about this dilemma is to seek out listings for
	  similar properties (near one another, about the same size,
	  roughly the same year of construction, etc.) and then
	  "bucket" two or more listings into one, using the average
	  sales price of the bucket together with the averare rent
	  amount of the bucket to create a single data point for our
	  analytics purposes. This module is an exercise in creativity
	  to seek out data, compare it, group it, represent it and
	  then build a model for it. Once the model is built, we can
	  begin to pose questions such as "if a house costs this much,
	  then what would it cost to rent one like it?". With some
	  basic math, we can use the same model to pose a vice-versa
	  question: "if this is how much rent is charged for an
	  apartment like this, what would it cost to buy one?".

	<h2 class="topic-heading">Learning outcomes</h2>
	<p>
	  This module will help you do the following:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	    <li>Identify potential data sources</li>
	    <li>Combine data from multiple sources</li>
	    <li>Fit a linear model to two-dimensional data</li>
	    <li>Quantify the error of a fitted model</li>
	    <li>Describe the quality of a fitted model</li>
	    <li>Consult a fitted model</li>
	    <li>Identify subgroups and outliers on a scatter plot</li>
	    <li>Invert a fitted model to the opposite question</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Warm-up</h2>
	<p>
	  An <a target="_blank"

	    guide</a> is the pre-class reading for this module.
	</p>

	<h3>Warm-up assessment</h3>
	<p>
	  Financial decision making is not the easiest. Charging too
	  much might make it hard to find a lessee while charging too
	  little, although philantrophic, is bad for business. To
	  figure out what's a good price, one has to get a feel for
	  the market. In the case of setting a rent, one may wish to
	  be inspired by rents of similar residences in similar
	  locations, while staying safely away from illegal rent
	  fixing. Elaborate in writing a paragraph of two what your
	  gut feeling is on what data one should gather before setting
	  the amount and how would one go about adjusting it to
	  observed demand?
	</p>
	
	<h2 class="topic-heading">Concepts</h2>
	<p>
	  After this module, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
	  <ul class="action-items">
	  <li>Regression</li>
	  <li>Curve fitting</li>
	  <li>Attribute</li>
	  <li>Model scope</li>
	  <li>Error</li>            
	  <li>Quality of fit</li>
	</ul>
	</p>	
	<p>
	  Remember that you can always look concepts up in the
	  <a target="_blank"
	     href="https://scs-technology-and-innovation.github.io/courses/TI.html">glossary</a>.
